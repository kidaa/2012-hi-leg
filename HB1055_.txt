TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO EDUCATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The recent implementation of the common core state standards initiative led by the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers, has resulted in a set of common core state standards in English language arts and mathematics that have been developed by teachers, school administrators, and experts to provide a clear and consistent framework to prepare students for college and the workforce.  These standards define the knowledge and skills students should possess within their K-12 education careers so that they will graduate high school able to succeed in entry-level, credit-bearing academic college courses and in workforce training programs.  Therefore, the administration of nationally norm-referenced tests is no longer necessary.
     The purpose of this Act is to repeal the inclusion of a norm-reference reading and mathematics tests in grades 3 through 8 and one high school grade in the statewide assessment program.  The board of education has adopted the common core state standards and Hawaii is a governing member of the SMARTER Balanced Assessment Consortium that will be developing and implementing a summative assessment in grades 3 through 8 and high school in English language arts and mathematics that will provide comparable achievement standards across all of the states that are members of the Consortium.
     SECTION 2.  Section 302A-201, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§302A-201  Statewide performance standards.  [(a)]  The board shall establish statewide performance standards and the means to assess the standards based upon the recommendations in the final report of the performance standards commission established pursuant to Act 334, Session Laws of Hawaii 1991; provided that the board may review and modify the performance standards, as the board deems necessary, to reflect the needs of public school students and educational goals adopted by the board.
     [(b)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the department shall establish procedures and guidelines for, and shall expand, its statewide assessment program to include norm-referenced testing in the same grades as required by the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110) standards-based assessment (grades 3 through 8 and one grade in high school) in reading and math, using the most appropriate nationally normed test.]"
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
