     (1)  Work and vocational or occupational training, including attendance, promptness, performance, cooperation, care of materials, and safety;
     (2)  Social adjustment, including group living, housekeeping, personal hygiene, and cooperation;

     (b)  The department shall develop objective standards for measuring consistent progress in the categories listed in subsection (a).  The standards shall be applied in all evaluations of inmates for the earned time authorized in this section.
     (c)  For each inmate committed to the custody of the director, the department shall review the performance record of the inmate and may grant, withhold, withdraw, or restore, consistent with this section, an earned time deduction from the sentence imposed.  The review shall be conducted quarterly, in the case of a misdemeanor, or annually, in the case of a felony, while the person is incarcerated and shall vest upon being granted.  In addition to any other sanctions, the director may refer to the prosecutor's office of the appropriate county all cases where the inmate tests positive for the presence of drugs.
     (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, earned time may not reduce the sentence of any inmate by a period of time that is more than twenty-five per cent of the sentence or minimum term."
