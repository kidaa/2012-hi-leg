TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

PART I
     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the temporary exemptions are necessary to expedite the construction and improvement of public housing units and public infrastructure.  The legislature also finds that temporary exemptions achieve the dual benefits of promoting jobs in the local economy and developing valuable public assets.  Moreover, the legislature finds that the repair and maintenance of vacant public housing units should reduce the turnaround time between vacating and incoming tenants, resulting in an increase in the affordable housing inventory.
     The purpose of this part is to address economic revitalization.  More specifically, this part temporarily exempts the following from the state and county civil service:
     (1)  Persons hired or contracted to repair and maintain vacant public housing units; and
     (2)  Persons hired or contracted to perform planning, design, engineering, or permit processing work for state or county capital improvement projects.
     SECTION 2.  Section 46-33, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§46-33  Exemption of certain county positions.  In any county with a population of 500,000 or more, the civil service to which this section refers is comprised of all positions in the public service of [such] the county, now existing or hereafter established, and embraces all personal services performed for [such] the county, except the following:
     (1)  Positions of officers elected by public vote; positions of heads of departments; position of the clerk; position of the manager of the board of water supply and position of the chief of police[.];
     (2)  Positions in the office of the mayor, but [such] those  positions, except those of the heads of the offices of information and complaint and budget director, shall be included in the position classification plan.  Employees of the municipal library and of the offices of information and complaint and budget director, other than the heads of [such] the offices, however, shall not be exempted from civil service[.];

     (6)  Positions of district magistrates, jurors, and witnesses[.];
     (7)  Personal services obtained by contract where the director of civil service has certified that the service is special or unique, is essential to the public interest and that, because of circumstances surrounding its fulfillment, personnel to perform [such] the service cannot be obtained through normal civil service recruitment procedures.  Any such contract may be for any period not exceeding one year[.];
     (8)  Personal services of a temporary nature needed in the public interest where the need for the same does not exceed ninety days, but before any person may be employed to render [such] the temporary service, the director of civil service shall certify that the service is of a temporary nature and that recruitment through normal civil service recruitment procedures is not practicable.  The employment of any person for service of a temporary nature may be extended for good cause for an additional period not to exceed ninety days upon similar certification by the director subject to approval of the civil service commission[.];
     (9)  Personal services performed on a fee, contract, or piecework basis by persons who may lawfully perform their duties concurrently with their private business or profession or other private employment, if any, and whose duties require only a portion of their time, where it is impracticable to ascertain or anticipate the portion of time devoted to the service of the city and [such] that fact is certified to by the director of civil service[.];
    (10)  Positions of temporary election clerks in the office of the clerk employed during the election periods, but the positions filled by [such] those employees shall be included in the position classification plan[.];
    (11)  Positions of one first deputy and private secretaries to heads of departments and their first deputies, but private secretarial positions shall be included in the position classification plan.  The first deputy in the department of civil service, however, shall not be exempt from civil service[.]; and
    (12)  From July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2015, persons hired or contracted to perform:
         (A)  Repair or maintenance work on vacant housing units under the jurisdiction of the county; or
         (B)  Planning, design, engineering, or permit processing work for capital improvement projects of a county agency.
The director of civil service shall determine the applicability of this section to specific positions."
     SECTION 3.  Section 76-16, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:

PART II
     SECTION 6.   The legislature finds that many public housing projects in the State of Hawaii are in poor condition.  During the 2010 federal inspections for housing projects last year, eleven out of the sixty-five federal housing projects failed to pass inspection, receiving a score of fifty-nine or below out of a possible one hundred, and approximately one-third of the housing projects, received a score of sixty-nine or below.  To address the host of problems plaguing public housing, the Hawaii public housing authority recently embarked on a major turnaround plan.  The plan involves revamping vacant units, streamlining how applications are processed, and encouraging a fast turnaround for filling vacancies.  In recent reports, there are as many as four hundred to six hundred units not being rented due to uninhabitable conditions.  According to a 2003 assessment at Kuhio Park Terrace, the largest and one of the oldest public housing projects in Hawaii, the estimated capital improvement cost would be approximately sixty-three million dollars.
     The legislature also finds that in addition to the increasing problems in public housing, high unemployment in the construction and trade industry exacerbates the economic problems for individuals that are within the low to moderate income population.  This population is commonly referred to as the "gap group," and include individuals with gross incomes that fall between one hundred twenty-five per cent and two hundred fifty per cent of federal poverty guidelines.  This population is especially vulnerable to becoming homeless if adequate, habitable, and affordable housing is unavailable.
     The purpose of this part is to provide funding to improve public housing stock.
     SECTION 7.  The director of finance is authorized to issue general obligation bonds in the sum of $5,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary is appropriated for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the purpose of renovating public housing units that are uninhabitable.
     SECTION 8.  There is appropriated out of the rental housing trust fund for the sum of $5,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for renovating public housing units that are uninhabitable.
     SECTION 9.  The sums appropriated under sections 7 and 8 shall be expended by the Hawaii public housing authority, for the purposes of this part.
     SECTION 10.  The appropriations made for capital improvement project authorized by this part shall not lapse at the end of the fiscal biennium for which the appropriation is made; provided that all moneys from the appropriation unencumbered as of June 30, 2014, shall lapse as of that date.
     SECTION 11.  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, capital improvement projects executed under this part shall be exempt from the contest provisions of chapter 103D, Hawaii Revised Statutes.
PART III
     SECTION 12.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 13.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012; provided that part I of this Act shall be repealed on June 30, 2015, and 46-33, 76-16(b), and 76-77, Hawaii Revised Statutes, shall be reenacted in the form in which they read on the day before the effective date of this Act.
