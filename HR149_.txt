TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE ACADEMIC CREDIT OR SOME OTHER INCENTIVE OR PENALTY TO MOTIVATE STUDENTS TO TAKE THE ADEQUATE YEARLY PROGRESS TESTS SERIOUSLY.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Department of Education administers the Adequate Yearly Progress tests for public school students pursuant to the federal No Child Left Behind program; and
 
     WHEREAS, the No Child Left Behind program requires each state to define "adequate yearly progress" for its students and to determine and quantify the progress that will be made in student achievement annually until 2014, when all students must reach a definable level of academic proficiency; and
 
     WHEREAS, if a school fails to achieve academic proficiency, the school is then subject to technical assistance but must allow students to transfer to another school if the student so chooses; and
 
     WHEREAS, the longer a school fails to reach proficiency, sanctions against the school become progressively more severe until the school is taken-over by the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is imperative that students take the Adequate Yearly Progress tests seriously to prevent the imposition of sanctions that could disrupt the administration of public schools; and
 
     WHEREAS, anecdotal information from students and teachers suggests that students do not appear to be taking the Adequate Yearly Progress tests seriously; and
 
     WHEREAS, reports of students misusing their answer bubbles on the tests by strategically connecting the bubbles to create a picture or message strongly suggests that some students do not appreciate the consequences of their actions; and
 
     WHEREAS, some students intentionally perform poorly in order to reflect negatively on teachers they do not like; and
 
     WHEREAS, there does not appear to be any incentive for students to do well on the Adequate Yearly Progress tests or penalty for doing poorly; and
 
     WHEREAS, generally, students are of the opinion that anywhere from twenty-five to fifty per cent of the students taking the test do not do so seriously; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Board of Education is urged to provide academic credit or some other incentive or penalty to motivate students to take the Adequate Yearly Progress tests seriously; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, the Chairperson of the Board of Education, and the Superintendent of Education.
