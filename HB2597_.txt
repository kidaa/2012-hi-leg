     (c)  If the [written public] notice is [filed in the office of the lieutenant governor or] posted on the state or county calendar or filed in the appropriate county clerk's office less than six calendar days before the meeting, the [lieutenant governor] board's electronic notice shall be rejected by the electronic calendar or the appropriate county clerk shall immediately notify the chairperson of the board, or the director of the department within which the board is established or placed, of the tardy filing of the meeting notice.  If there is a dispute as to whether a notice was timely filed on an electronic calendar, a printout of the electronically time-stamped agenda shall be conclusive evidence of the filing date.  [The] If a meeting notice is filed late, the meeting shall be canceled as a matter of law, and the chairperson of the board or the department director shall ensure that a notice canceling the meeting is posted in the board's office and at the place of the meeting, and no meeting shall be held.
     (d)  No board shall change the agenda, once filed, by adding items thereto without a two-thirds recorded vote of all members to which the board is entitled; provided that no item shall be added to the agenda if it is of reasonably major importance and action thereon by the board will affect a significant number of persons.  Items of reasonably major importance not decided at a scheduled meeting shall be considered only at a meeting continued to a reasonable day and time.
     (e)  The board shall maintain a list of names and addresses of persons who request notification of meetings and shall mail or electronically transmit a copy of the notice to such persons at their last recorded address no later than the time the agenda is [filed] posted under subsection (b)."

     (2)  Two-thirds of all members to which the board is entitled agree that the findings are correct and an emergency exists;

     (b)  If an unanticipated event requires a board to take action on a matter over which it has supervision, control, jurisdiction, or advisory power, within less time than is provided for in section 92-7 to notice and convene a meeting of the board, the board may hold an emergency meeting to deliberate and decide whether and how to act in response to the unanticipated event; provided that:
     (1)  The board states in writing the reasons for its finding that an unanticipated event has occurred and that an emergency meeting is necessary and the attorney general if a state board, or the county counsel if a county board, concurs that the conditions necessary for an emergency meeting under this subsection exist;
     (2)  Two-thirds of all members to which the board is entitled agree that the conditions necessary for an emergency meeting under this subsection exist;
     (3)  [The finding that an unanticipated event has occurred and that an emergency meeting is necessary and the agenda for the emergency meeting under this subsection are filed with the office of the lieutenant governor or the appropriate county clerk's office, and in the board's office;] An emergency agenda and the findings are posted or filed as required for notices by section 92-7;
     (4)  Persons requesting notification on a regular basis are contacted by mail, [or] telephone, or electronically as soon as practicable; and
     (5)  The board limits its action to only that action which must be taken on or before the date that a meeting would have been held, had the board noticed the meeting pursuant to section 92-7.
     (c)  For purposes of this part, an "unanticipated event" means:
     (1)  An event which members of the board did not have sufficient advance knowledge of or reasonably could not have known about from information published by the media or information generally available in the community;
     (2)  A deadline established by a legislative body, a court, or a federal, state, or county agency beyond the control of a board; or
     (3)  A consequence of an event for which reasonably informed and knowledgeable board members could not have taken all necessary action."
