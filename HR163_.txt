HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TO REVIEW AND REPORT ON POLICIES RELATING TO THE USE OF DRIVERLESS VEHICLES IN HAWAII.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, about 40,000 deaths occur each year on America's highways; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Google research team has developed a driverless car to help improve highway safety by limiting human error; and
 
WHEREAS, in road tests of an autonomous vehicle conducted by Google, not a single accident occurred in more than 100,000 miles of driving; and
 
     WHEREAS, there have only been two accidents since 2010 involving Google's driverless cars; and both of those mishaps were caused by human error when the Google car was rear-ended; and
 
WHEREAS, Google's autonomous cars safely navigate roads through the use of artificial intelligence software, global positioning systems and sensors; and
 
     WHEREAS, driverless cars have many advantages over human-driven vehicles, including the fact that machines do not become tired, angry or distracted, and can be aware of more variables that occur on the road; and
 
     WHEREAS, autonomous cars can be built lighter than traditional vehicles, thus increasing fuel efficiency; and
 
     WHEREAS, autonomous cars can be driver closer together than traditional vehicles, resulting in less congested roads; and
 
     WHEREAS, Nevada passed a law to allow Google to test its driverless cars in the state and address legal issues that may arise when no human driver is behind the wheel of a motor vehicle; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii should following Nevada's lead and adopt policies to allow the use of driverless cars that would result in greater fuel efficiency, safer traffic conditions and less congested roads; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Department of Transportation is requested to review its by-laws and policies, applicable administrative rules and statutes, as well as any internal practices and procedures, that could relate to driverless cars; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that following such review, the Department of Transportation shall report to the Legislature prior to the Regular Session of 2013 on the findings of their review and offer suggestions for legislation that would allow the use of driverless cars in Hawaii; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the governor of the State of Hawaii, the director of the Department of Transportation, and Google Inc.
