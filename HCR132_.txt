HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES TO ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE HONOLULU POLICE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF SECURITY AND RULE ENFORCEMENT AT HARBORS OPERATED AND MANAGED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES ON OAHU.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Department of Land and Natural Resources, through its Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation, operates and manages 21 boat harbors throughout the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement:
 
(1)  Is responsible for enforcement activities of the Department of Land and Natural Resources;
 
(2)  With full police powers, enforces all state laws and rules involving state lands, state parks, historic sites, forest reserves, aquatic life and wildlife areas, coastal zones, conservation districts, state shores, as well as county ordinances involving county parks; and
 
(3)  Relatedly enforces certain laws relating to firearms, ammunition, and dangerous weapons; and
 
     WHEREAS, Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement officers operate during normal business hours at harbors operated and managed by the Department of Land and Natural Resources, and are on call after hours; and
 
     WHEREAS, some boaters have expressed concern that the limited hours of enforcement negatively affects overall management and enforcement of harbor rules and security for moored vessels and liveaboards; and
 
     WHEREAS, boaters and other persons at the harbors are often left without any recourse when this Division's office is closed or when the Division, while on call, does not answer the call; and
 
     WHEREAS, though the Honolulu Police Department has been responsive in addressing some activities at the harbors, the police cannot address many issues impacting the public welfare and safety that are within the Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement's jurisdiction and there is public and agency confusion over the respective jurisdictions of these agencies; and
 
     WHEREAS, for example, among the many problems that need timely Division assistance are public disturbances and annoyances caused by excessive noise, including barking dogs, and incidents of reckless boating in the harbors; and
 
     WHEREAS, a lack of funding has been cited as a reason for not being able to extend the Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement officers' hours of operation; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Land and Natural Resources is urged to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Honolulu Police Department to address the lack of security and rule enforcement at harbors operated and managed by the Department of Land and Natural Resources on Oahu; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Land and Natural Resources is requested to submit an executed copy of the memorandum of understanding and a written report of findings and recommendations, including any necessary proposed legislation, to the Legislature no later than 20 days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources and Chief of Police of the Honolulu Police Department.
