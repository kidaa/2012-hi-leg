HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
CONGRATULATING KA LEO O HAWAII ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 90TH ANNIVERSARY.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, while the natural beauty of Hawaii is recognized throughout the world, the beauty of our island state also lies in its people, who through personal relationships with family, friends, and neighbors and dedicated efforts to serve the needs of others, have created the prosperity and high living standards we enjoy today; and
 
     WHEREAS, in September of 1922, a group of students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa started the campus’ first weekly newspaper, The Hawaii Mirror, to foster student engagement in university affairs and inform the student body and the general public of campus news and events; and
 
     WHEREAS, the name of that newspaper was changed by a student vote two months later to KA LEO O HAWAII, The Voice of Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, KA LEO O HAWAII has been a training ground for community leaders and professional journalists and photographers such as Yasuo Baron Goto, Walter Short, Shuzo Sakamaki, Hiram Fong, Reuben Tam, Joshua Agsalud, Gerald Kato, Richard Borreca, Robert Lopez, Daryl Huff, Betty Shimabukuro, K. Mark Takai, Jim McCoy, Mary Vorsino, Ikaika Hussey, Michael Keany, among hundreds of others throughout the islands and around the world; and
 
     WHEREAS, the University of Hawaii at Manoa has remained committed to a free college press by allowing students to make decisions about what should be covered; and      WHEREAS, students handle all aspects of KA LEO O HAWAII operations from writing to editing, designing, advertising, and promoting their newspaper and website; and
 
     WHEREAS, KA LEO O HAWAII writers have successfully competed against their professional counterparts in breaking news stories and have been willing to challenge others who would suppress their First Amendment Rights; and
 
     WHEREAS, KA LEO O HAWAII staffers have won national awards for editorial and advertising excellence; and
 
     WHEREAS, KA LEO O HAWAII’s circulation of 10,000 copies three times a week makes it one of the largest circulating newspapers in the State after the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Hawaii Tribune-Herald, The Maui News, and West Hawaii Today; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that this body hereby congratulates KA LEO O HAWAII on the occasion of its 90th Anniversary, commends the University of Hawaii at Manoa for maintaining its commitment to a free student press for 90 years, and respectfully requests the University of Hawaii at Manoa and KA LEO O HAWAII to continue to maintain that tradition.
