A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO TELECOMMUTING.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Chapter 235, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§235-     Telecommuting tax credit.  (a)  There shall be allowed to each individual or corporate taxpayer who is not claimed, or is not otherwise eligible to be claimed, as a dependent by another taxpayer for federal or state income tax purposes, a telecommuting tax credit that shall be deductible from the taxpayer's net income tax liability imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the tax credit is properly claimed.
     For the purpose of this section, "telecommute" means a work arrangement between an employer and employee whereby an employee performs at least seventy-five per cent of the employee's job or duties at the employee's residence instead of commuting to a place of employment that is situated away from the employee's residence.
     (b)  To qualify for the tax credit, the taxpayer shall be:
     (1)  An employer who permits one or more full-time employees to telecommute; and
     (2)  In compliance with all applicable federal, state, and county statutes, rules, and regulations.
     (c)  The tax credit shall be equal to     per cent of an employer's costs related to allowing an employee to telecommute, multiplied by the number of employees who have telecommuted for the entire taxable year.
     (d)  If the tax credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer's net income tax liability, the amount of the excess tax credit shall be paid to the eligible taxpayer; provided that no refund or payment on account of the tax credit allowed by this section shall be made for amounts less than $1.
     (e)  Every claim, including amended claims, for the tax credit under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the tax credit may be claimed.  Failure to meet the filing requirements of this subsection shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the tax credit.
     (f)  The director of taxation:
     (1)  Shall prepare forms as may be necessary to claim a tax credit under this section;
     (2)  May require proof of the claim for the tax credit; and
     (3)  May adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to effectuate the purposes of this section."
     SECTION 2.  Section 46-1.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§46-1.5  General powers and limitation of the counties.  Subject to general law, each county shall have the following powers and shall be subject to the following liabilities and limitations:

     (24) (A)  Each county may impose civil fines, in addition to criminal penalties, for any violation of county ordinances or rules after reasonable notice and requests to correct or cease the violation have been made upon the violator.  Any administratively imposed civil fine shall not be collected until after an opportunity for a hearing under chapter 91.  Any appeal shall be filed within thirty days from the date of the final written decision.  These proceedings shall not be a prerequisite for any civil fine or injunctive relief ordered by the circuit court;
         (B)  Each county by ordinance may provide for the addition of any unpaid civil fines, ordered by any court of competent jurisdiction, to any taxes, fees, or charges, with the exception of fees or charges for water for residential use and sewer charges, collected by the county.  Each county by ordinance may also provide for the addition of any unpaid administratively imposed civil fines, which remain due after all judicial review rights under section 91-14 are exhausted, to any taxes, fees, or charges, with the exception of water for residential use and sewer charges, collected by the county.  The ordinance shall specify the administrative procedures for the addition of the unpaid civil fines to the eligible taxes, fees, or charges and may require hearings or other proceedings.  After addition of the unpaid civil fines to the taxes, fees, or charges, the unpaid civil fines shall not become a part of any taxes, fees, or charges.  The county by ordinance may condition the issuance or renewal of a license, approval, or permit for which a fee or charge is assessed, except for water for residential use and sewer charges, on payment of the unpaid civil fines.  Upon recordation of a notice of unpaid civil fines in the bureau of conveyances, the amount of the civil fines, including any increase in the amount of the fine which the county may assess, shall constitute a lien upon all real property or rights to real property belonging to any person liable for the unpaid civil fines.  The lien in favor of the county shall be subordinate to any lien in favor of any person recorded or registered prior to the recordation of the notice of unpaid civil fines and senior to any lien recorded or registered after the recordation of the notice.  The lien shall continue until the unpaid civil fines are paid in full or until a certificate of release or partial release of the lien, prepared by the county at the owner's expense, is recorded.  The notice of unpaid civil fines shall state the amount of the fine as of the date of the notice and maximum permissible daily increase of the fine.  The county shall not be required to include a social security number, state general excise taxpayer identification number, or federal employer identification number on the notice.  Recordation of the notice in the bureau of conveyances shall be deemed, at such time, for all purposes and without any further action, to procure a lien on land registered in land court under chapter 501.  After the unpaid civil fines are added to the taxes, fees, or charges as specified by county ordinance, the unpaid civil fines shall be deemed immediately due, owing, and delinquent and may be collected in any lawful manner.  The procedure for collection of unpaid civil fines authorized in this paragraph shall be in addition to any other procedures for collection available to the State and county by law or rules of the courts;
         (C)  Each county may impose civil fines upon any person who places graffiti on any real or personal property owned, managed, or maintained by the county.  The fine may be up to $1,000 or may be equal to the actual cost of having the damaged property repaired or replaced.  The parent or guardian having custody of a minor who places graffiti on any real or personal property owned, managed, or maintained by the county shall be jointly and severally liable with the minor for any civil fines imposed hereunder.  Any such fine may be administratively imposed after an opportunity for a hearing under chapter 91, but such a proceeding shall not be a prerequisite for any civil fine ordered by any court.  As used in this subparagraph, "graffiti" means any unauthorized drawing, inscription, figure, or mark of any type intentionally created by paint, ink, chalk, dye, or similar substances;
         (D)  At the completion of an appeal in which the county's enforcement action is affirmed and upon correction of the violation if requested by the violator, the case shall be reviewed by the county agency that imposed the civil fines to determine the appropriateness of the amount of the civil fines that accrued while the appeal proceedings were pending.  In its review of the amount of the accrued fines, the county agency may consider:
              (i)  The nature and egregiousness of the violation;
             (ii)  The duration of the violation;
            (iii)  The number of recurring and other similar violations;
             (iv)  Any effort taken by the violator to correct the violation;
              (v)  The degree of involvement in causing or continuing the violation;
             (vi)  Reasons for any delay in the completion of the appeal; and
            (vii)  Other extenuating circumstances.
              The civil fine that is imposed by administrative order after this review is completed and the violation is corrected shall be subject to judicial review, notwithstanding any provisions for administrative review in county charters;
         (E)  After completion of a review of the amount of accrued civil fine by the county agency that imposed the fine, the amount of the civil fine determined appropriate, including both the initial civil fine and any accrued daily civil fine, shall immediately become due and collectible following reasonable notice to the violator.  If no review of the accrued civil fine is requested, the amount of the civil fine, not to exceed the total accrual of civil fine prior to correcting the violation, shall immediately become due and collectible following reasonable notice to the violator, at the completion of all appeal proceedings;
         (F)  If no county agency exists to conduct appeal proceedings for a particular civil fine action taken by the county, then one shall be established by ordinance before the county shall impose the civil fine;
    (25)  Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any county mayor, by executive order, may exempt donors, provider agencies, homeless facilities, and any other program for the homeless under part XVII of chapter 346 from real property taxes, water and sewer development fees, rates collected for water supplied to consumers and for use of sewers, and any other county taxes, charges, or fees; provided that any county may enact ordinances to regulate and grant the exemptions granted by this paragraph;
    (26)  Any county may establish a captive insurance company pursuant to article 19, chapter 431; [and]
    (27)  Each county shall have the power to enact and enforce ordinances regulating towing operations[.]; and
    (28)  No county, whether by charter, ordinance, rule, policy, or interpretation of any of them, shall prohibit or restrict any person from engaging or participating in telecommuting, as the term is used in section 235-   ; provided that the business activity conducted or promoted through telecommuting in or at an employee's residence does not generate excessive noise, dust, debris, or traffic in the area where the employee is engaged in telecommuting."
     SECTION 3.  Section 1 of this Act shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010.
     SECTION 4.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
