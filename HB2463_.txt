TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO PUBLIC LAND LIABILITY.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The warning sign liability protections provided in Act 82, Session Laws of Hawaii 2003, will sunset on June 30, 2014.  Act 82 established a process by which a legally adequate warning system could be developed for improved public lands.  The legislature finds that Act 82 has increased public safety and protects the State and counties from unlimited liability arising out of recreational activities on public lands and, therefore, should be made permanent.
     The purpose of this Act is to make permanent the liability protections for warning signs for outdoor recreation on public lands.
     SECTION 2.  Act 82, Session Laws of Hawaii 2003, as amended by section 5 of Act 152, Session Laws of Hawaii 2007, and by section 3 of Act 81, Session Laws of Hawaii 2009, is amended by amending section 8 to read as follows:
     "SECTION 8.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2003[, and shall be repealed on June 30, 2014]."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
