TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Act 160, Session Laws of Hawaii 2006, directed the department of budget and finance to conduct a study on providing post-retirement allowance increases to retirees, particularly those individuals who have been retired for a great number of years.  The resulting study indicated that in the interest of fairness, any allowance increase should take into account the number of years that an individual has been in retirement as well as the number of years of service that the retiree rendered to the State. 
     The legislature finds that the last time an ad hoc increase was provided by the employees' retirement system was the 2002‑2003 fiscal year.  That increase was a one-time, lump sum pension bonus for retirees age seventy and older, with twenty or more years of service.
     The purpose of this Act is to help offset the effects of inflation on older retirees' pensions by providing an annual lump sum payment to retirees who are at least seventy-five years old and who have been in retirement for at least twenty years.  The legislature notes that the payments provided by this Act to certain older retirees shall be lump sum payments and are not intended to provide an enhanced pension benefit.
     SECTION 2.  Section 88-11, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§88-11  Bonus; pensioners' special compensation; amounts available.  (a)  Except as [herein] provided[,] in this section, every pension payable under the [employees] employees' retirement system [or payable], pursuant to any law of the State, or by any county or independent public board or commission[,] shall be increased by a bonus for each month as follows:
     (1)  Effective July 1, 1976, $77.82 per month to those retirants and pensioners who had, before July 1, 1966, ten or more years of service; provided that any member who is retired because of physical or mental disability due to any injury or disease incurred while in the performance of the member's duty as a public employee shall be entitled to receive the bonus payment without meeting the minimum service requirement;
     (2)  Effective July 1, 1976, $31.12 per month additional to the [above] bonus provided in paragraph (1) to those retirants or pensioners who retired before July 1, 1945;
     (3)  Effective July 1, 1976, $31.12 per month additional to the above [bonus or] bonuses provided in paragraphs (1) and (2) to those retirants or pensioners who have had twenty-one or more years of service;
     (4)  Effective July 1, 1976, if the pension as increased by the bonus or bonuses does not equal $202.32 per month, the bonus shall be further increased by [such] the sum, not in excess of $31.12, as will bring the total of the pension and bonus to $202.32 per month; provided that where the dependents of a deceased pensioner are receiving pension by reasons of the pensioner's death, the total only of all amounts paid to all of the dependents shall be [so] increased, and the increase [herein] shall be shared by [them] the dependents in proportion to the respective amount of pension receivable by [them] each dependent exclusive of this increase;
     (5)  In the case of any retirement allowance for service commencing after June 30, 1965, paid pursuant to paragraph (1) or (3) of section 88-74, the only bonus payable shall be in the amount by which the benefit payable under [the] paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 88-74 is less than the bonus [as set forth above;] as provided in paragraph (4) of this section; provided that in no case shall a person who retires after June 30, 1965, receive less under the service and ordinary disability retirement system benefits, plus the bonus payable under this section than the person would have received if this paragraph [(5)] had not been enacted;
     (6)  Any provisions of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, there shall be paid to every person who on June 30, 1965, was receiving a retirement allowance from the system or other pension payable under or pursuant to the law of the State or by any county or independent board or commission, a special cost of living bonus, which shall be paid in the following manner:

         (C)  On July 1, 1970, an additional ten per cent of the retirement allowance or pension;

     (7)  Any provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, there shall be paid to every person who retired between July 1, 1965, and June 30, 1970, and who, on June 30, 1974, was receiving a retirement allowance from the system or other pension payable under or pursuant to the law of the State or by any county or independent board or commission, a special cost of living bonus which shall be paid in the following manner:
