TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
MAKING AN APPROPRIATION FOR CERVICAL AND BREAST CANCER SCREENING.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The Hawaii breast and cervical cancer program was established in 1993 through a cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide breast and cervical cancer screening services under the national breast and cervical cancer early detection program.  Excluding skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women and is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer-related death.  Many of these deaths, which will occur disproportionately among women of racial and ethnic minority and low-income groups, could be avoided by making cancer screening services available to all women at risk.
     The purpose of this Act is to make an appropriation to provide funding to the department of health for breast and cervical cancer screening to reach more women who are eligible to be screened under the screening program.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 to the department of health for breast and cervical cancer screening to  reach more women who are eligible to be screened under the screening program.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of health for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
