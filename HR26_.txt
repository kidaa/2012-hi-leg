HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
EXPRESSING CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE PROHIBITION OF GAMBLING IN HAWAII, AS RECOMMENDED BY THE 2011 HAWAII SECONDARY STUDENT CONFERENCE.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, Hawaii and Utah are the only states that prohibit gambling; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is estimated that twenty million citizens of the United States are problem or compulsive gamblers; and
 
     WHEREAS, gambling is an addictive behavior that can cause problem gamblers to neglect their job, family, and friends to pursue gambling whether they win or lose, resulting in bankruptcy or debt; and
 
     WHEREAS, four to six percent of high school students are reported to be addicted to gambling, and another ten to fourteen percent are at risk of becoming addicts; and
 
     WHEREAS, gambling leads to an increase in crimes, such as fraud, identity theft, money laundering, pan-handling, and robbery that could harm Hawaii's vital tourism industry; and
 
     WHEREAS, when gambling was legalized in Atlantic City the overall crime rate rose three hundred twenty percent and cases of rape rose one hundred percent; and
 
     WHEREAS, gambling leads to higher incarceration rates, costing taxpayers an estimated $30,000 per year per inmate; and
 
     WHEREAS, casinos and other gambling establishments adversely impact small business owners by taking away customers; and
     WHEREAS, various measures to permit gambling have been introduced in the current legislative session as a purported solution to the State's economic woes; and
 
     WHEREAS, after extensive debate and deliberation, the 2011 Hawaii Secondary Student Conference recommends, in light of the adverse effects of gambling to the public health and welfare and the image and economy of our state, that gambling remain a prohibited activity; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that this body recognizes the position of the 2011 Hawaii Secondary Student Conference and expresses its continued support for the prohibition of gambling in Hawaii; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this body supports looking at options other than gambling to improve Hawaii's economy; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor.
