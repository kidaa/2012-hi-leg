A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO BIRTH DEFECTS WARNINGS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that there is a need for public information about the risk of birth defects, specifically fetal alcohol syndrome, when women consume alcoholic beverages during pregnancy.  The United States Surgeon General has recommended that women abstain from alcohol during pregnancy.  The legislature believes that alcohol-related birth defects are preventable if people are aware of the risks.
     The purpose of this Act is to require establishments that serve alcoholic beverages to post notification to inform customers of the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
     SECTION 2.  Section 281-44, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  All licensed premises shall post [a sign] notification in or about the premises, conspicuously positioned in order to be seen by an ordinarily observant person, containing and notifying all customers [and other persons] of:
     (1)  [the] The possible sanctions that may be imposed for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant under sections 291E-41 and 291E-61; and
     (2)  The dangers of consuming alcoholic beverages during pregnancy.
[The sign shall be conspicuously positioned in order to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.]  Failure to display notification required by this subsection shall subject the licensed premises to a fine of not more than $100 for each offense; provided that prior to the first fine under this subsection the liquor commission shall provide the licensed premises with written notice of the violation and thirty days to cure the violation."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
