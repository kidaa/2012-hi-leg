HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE HAWAII TEACHER STANDARDS BOARD TO REVIEW RULES REGARDING LICENSING OF TEACHERS IN HAWAII WITH OUT-OF-STATE TEACHING LICENSES TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE BARRIERS TO THOSE TEACHERS BEING LICENSED IN HAWAII.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Hawaii Teacher Standards Board is the governing body that issues and renews teaching licenses in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, there is a shortage of public school teachers in the State of Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, there is a concern that teachers with out-of-state teaching licenses have experienced difficulties when trying to obtain teaching licenses in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, enabling qualified teachers with out-of-state teaching licenses to obtain a teaching license in Hawaii would increase the number of qualified teachers in the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, having an increased number of qualified licensed teachers would foster a higher quality of educators and improve the achievement level of public school students in Hawaii; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Hawaii Teacher Standards Board is requested to review its rules regarding licensing of teachers with out-of-state teaching licenses to determine if there are barriers to those teachers being licensed in Hawaii; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Hawaii Teacher Standards Board is requested to receive input from school administrators and Department of Education teachers with out-of-state teaching licenses; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the members of the Hawaii Teacher Standards Board, the Superintendent of Education, and the members of the Board of Education.
