TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO PUBLIC HOUSING.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that when a vacancy occurs for the resident member seat on the Hawaii public housing authority board of directors, the resident advisory board is required to submit a list of five nominees for consideration by the governor.  However, there may be situations where fewer than five individuals are interested in the seat, which results in a delay in providing a list to the governor and the resident member seat remaining vacant for extended periods.
     The legislature believes it is important for the residents to have a voice on the board.  Additionally, a vacancy may jeopardize federal funds because the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development requires the board of directors to include a resident member.
     Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to make the nomination process more flexible by allowing for a minimum of three but no more than five individuals on the list of nominees for the resident member seat.
     SECTION 2.  Section 356D-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  If a vacancy occurs for the resident member seat on the board, the resident advisory board shall compile a list of no less than three but no more than five individuals for the governor's consideration for appointment to the board; provided that the nominees to the board shall be:
     (1)  Participants who are directly assisted by the authority under the federal public housing or section 8 tenant-based programs and who need not be members of the resident advisory board;
     (2)  At least eighteen years of age; and
     (3)  Authorized members of the assisted household."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.   SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
