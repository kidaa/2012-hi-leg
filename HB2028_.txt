A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE PREVENTION OF WORKPLACE VIOLENCE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
"CHAPTER     
HAWAII WORKPLACE VIOLENCE PREVENTION ACT
     §    -1  Short title.  This chapter shall be known as the Hawaii Workplace Violence Prevention Act.
     §    -2  Findings and Purpose.  The legislature finds that workplace violence is a problem growing at an alarming rate throughout the State of Hawaii and the United States.  Workplace violence results in over five hundred deaths each year in the United States, making it the second leading cause of occupational fatalities in the country.  Meanwhile, it is the leading cause of occupational fatalities for women.
     Events experienced in our community have graphically and tragically demonstrated that the State of Hawaii is not immune to the problem of workplace violence.  Accordingly, the legislature finds that new laws are necessary to protect the people of the State of Hawaii in the workforce who are vulnerable to such violence and their spouses, children, parents, family, friends, and co-workers who are equally impacted when workplace violence results in tragedy.  The legislature finds that employers who are committed to maintaining safe working environments currently lack efficient and effective tools to obtain judicial relief for the prevention of workplace violence.
     Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to provide a simple and efficient mechanism for employers and employees to obtain judicial relief for the prevention and control of workplace violence.
§    -3  Definitions.  As used in this chapter:

(c)  The court may issue an ex parte temporary restraining order either orally or in writing; provided that an oral order shall be reduced to writing by the court as expeditiously as practicable following issuance of the oral order.
(d)  For the purposes of this chapter, there shall be a presumption that violence or the threat of violence shall constitute irreparable harm, and that the prevention and restraint of violence and the threat of violence shall be in the public interest.
     §    -6  Acts of violence and threats of violence to be enjoined or temporarily restrained.  (a)  Any temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction issued pursuant to this chapter shall enjoin the respondent from performing any of the following acts:

     (2)  Making any threat of violence;

(b)  The court may order that the respondent reimburse:
     (1)  The petitioner’s related and reasonable medical expenses, including reasonable expenses for mental health counseling;
     (2)  The petitioner’s reasonable legal fees and costs; or

(d)  Consistent with the rights afforded by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the Hawaii State Constitution, if the court has probable cause to believe that the violence or threat of violence sought to be restrained pursuant to this chapter involves the use of a firearm, any temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction issued pursuant to this chapter may direct the department of public safety or the appropriate county police department to immediately search the respondent’s premises and property, including the respondent’s current residence and all motor vehicles registered in the respondent’s name or to which respondent has access, for the purposes of locating and seizing any and all firearms, ammunition, or ammunition loading, packing, or manufacturing devices, found during such a search, and to confiscate any firearms, ammunition, or ammunition loading, packing, or manufacturing devices located during such search until further order of the court.
(e)  In the case that any ammunition loading, packing, or manufacturing device located during such search may not conveniently be taken into custody, transported, and stored, due to its size, law enforcement officers shall remove such parts of the device necessary to render such device inoperable and shall take the removed parts into custody until further order of the court.
(f)  A temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction issued in accordance with subsection (c) and (d) shall be based on probable cause and shall have the same force and effect as a search warrant issued pursuant to part III of chapter 803.  The law enforcement department conducting any search and seizure pursuant to subsection (d) shall provide the petitioner or petitioner’s legal counsel with a complete written inventory list of any and all firearms or other items seized immediately following the search and seizure, and file a return of service of the order with the inventory list attached as an exhibit and the authorizing court order.

(b)  If the judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent engaged in violence or made a threat of violence, that future violence or that future threats of violence are possible, or that respondent has a propensity for violence, the court shall grant a preliminary injunction or permanent injunction.
(c)  The preliminary injunction or permanent injunction shall prohibit any of the acts listed in section    -6.
§    -9  Duration of injunction.  A preliminary injunction or permanent injunction issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a duration of not more than five years; provided that the petitioner may apply for periodic renewals of the preliminary injunction or permanent injunction at any time before expiration of the existing preliminary injunction or permanent injunction by filing a motion with the court.
§    -10  Service of restraining orders and injunctions.  (a) Upon the request of the petitioner, the court may order the department of public safety or the appropriate county police department to serve the temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction and related documents upon the respondent.
(b)  In the case that the petitioner elects not to request that the department of public safety or the appropriate county police department serve the temporary restraining order, preliminary order, or permanent injunction and other related documents, the petitioner may request that the order be forwarded by the clerk of court to the department of public safety or the appropriate police department, and any such request by petitioner shall be effectuated by the clerk of the court within twenty-four hours of the request.  The department of public safety and each appropriate county police department shall make available to other law enforcement officers, through a system for verification, information as to the existence of any temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction, or other order issued pursuant to this chapter.
§    -11  Violation of restraining order or injunction.  (a)  Any violation of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, or other related order issued pursuant to this chapter shall be punishable as criminal contempt as it is defined under section 710-1077.
(b)  Any violation of a temporary restraining order, preliminary, permanent injunction, or other related order issued pursuant to this chapter prohibiting the possession, control, use of any firearm or ammunition shall be punishable as an offense under section 134-7.
§    -12  Effect on other laws.  (a)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as creating, expanding, diminishing, altering, or modifying the duty, if any, of an employer to provide a safe workplace for employees and other persons, or to invoke or use the provisions of this chapter in any given circumstance.  The failure to invoke or use the provisions of this chapter shall not form the basis for any claim or liability against an employer.
(b)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any other rights or remedies available to an employer or employee under existing law, including the seeking of injunctive relief through methods other than the procedures set forth in this chapter; provided that no other state law shall limit the ability of an employer or employee from seeking relief pursuant to this chapter.
(c)  There shall be no civil liability for any employer or employee who initiates a proceeding pursuant to this chapter or who commits acts or makes statements in connection with any proceeding pursuant to this chapter or in connection with the investigation of any alleged act of violence or threat of violence in the workplace."
     SECTION 2.  If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the Act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable.
     SECTION 3.  This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.

(c)  Any temporary restraining order issued pursuant to this chapter shall order that the respondent immediately and affirmatively surrender all firearms, ammunition, or ammunition loading, packing, or manufacturing devices, in the respondent's possession, custody, or control to the appropriate county police department for safekeeping until further court order is issued, pursuant to section 134-7(f).
(d)  Consistent with the rights afforded by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the Hawaii State Constitution, if the court has probable cause to believe that the violence or threat of violence sought to be restrained pursuant to this chapter involves the use of a firearm, any temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction issued pursuant to this chapter may direct the department of public safety or the appropriate county police department to immediately search the respondent’s premises and property, including the respondent’s current residence and all motor vehicles registered in the respondent’s name or to which respondent has access, for the purposes of locating and seizing any and all firearms, ammunition, or ammunition loading, packing, or manufacturing devices, found during such a search, and to confiscate any firearms, ammunition, or ammunition loading, packing, or manufacturing devices located during such search until further order of the court.
(e)  In the case that any ammunition loading, packing, or manufacturing device located during such search may not conveniently be taken into custody, transported, and stored, due to its size, law enforcement officers shall remove such parts of the device necessary to render such device inoperable and shall take the removed parts into custody until further order of the court.
(f)  A temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction issued in accordance with subsection (c) and (d) shall be based on probable cause and shall have the same force and effect as a search warrant issued pursuant to part III of chapter 803.  The law enforcement department conducting any search and seizure pursuant to subsection (d) shall provide the petitioner or petitioner’s legal counsel with a complete written inventory list of any and all firearms or other items seized immediately following the search and seizure, and file a return of service of the order with the inventory list attached as an exhibit and the authorizing court order.
§    -7  Duration of temporary restraining order.  A temporary restraining order granted pursuant to this chapter shall remain in effect at the discretion of the court, for a period of time not to exceed ninety days from the date the temporary restraining order was granted; provided that either upon the motion of the petitioner or sua sponte decision of the court, the temporary restraining order may be extended periodically for reasonable periods of similar duration.
§    -8  Hearing on request for injunctive relief.  (a)  Prior to the expiration date of any temporary restraining order issued or extended pursuant to section     -7, the court shall hear any related petitions for preliminary or permanent injunctive relief.  Upon such motion, the respondent may respond to allegations of violence or threats of violence.  At the hearing, the judge shall receive any testimony that is relevant and reaches the propensity for violence of the respondent; provided that a petitioner’s use of evidence pertaining to a respondent’s arrest and court record in connection with any proceeding authorized by this chapter shall not constitute a violation of chapter 378 or any related administrative rules.
(b)  If the judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent engaged in violence or made a threat of violence, that future violence or that future threats of violence are possible, or that respondent has a propensity for violence, the court shall grant a preliminary injunction or permanent injunction.
(c)  The preliminary injunction or permanent injunction shall prohibit any of the acts listed in section    -6.
§    -9  Duration of injunction.  A preliminary injunction or permanent injunction issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a duration of not more than five years; provided that the petitioner may apply for periodic renewals of the preliminary injunction or permanent injunction at any time before expiration of the existing preliminary injunction or permanent injunction by filing a motion with the court.

(b)  In the case that the petitioner elects not to request that the department of public safety or the appropriate county police department serve the temporary restraining order, preliminary order, or permanent injunction and other related documents, the petitioner may request that the order be forwarded by the clerk of court to the department of public safety or the appropriate police department, and any such request by petitioner shall be effectuated by the clerk of the court within twenty-four hours of the request.  The department of public safety and each appropriate county police department shall make available to other law enforcement officers, through a system for verification, information as to the existence of any temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction, or other order issued pursuant to this chapter.
§    -11  Violation of restraining order or injunction.  (a)  Any violation of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, or other related order issued pursuant to this chapter shall be punishable as criminal contempt as it is defined under section 710-1077.
(b)  Any violation of a temporary restraining order, preliminary, permanent injunction, or other related order issued pursuant to this chapter prohibiting the possession, control, use of any firearm or ammunition shall be punishable as an offense under section 134-7.
§    -12  Effect on other laws.  (a)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as creating, expanding, diminishing, altering, or modifying the duty, if any, of an employer to provide a safe workplace for employees and other persons, or to invoke or use the provisions of this chapter in any given circumstance.  The failure to invoke or use the provisions of this chapter shall not form the basis for any claim or liability against an employer.
(b)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any other rights or remedies available to an employer or employee under existing law, including the seeking of injunctive relief through methods other than the procedures set forth in this chapter; provided that no other state law shall limit the ability of an employer or employee from seeking relief pursuant to this chapter.
(c)  There shall be no civil liability for any employer or employee who initiates a proceeding pursuant to this chapter or who commits acts or makes statements in connection with any proceeding pursuant to this chapter or in connection with the investigation of any alleged act of violence or threat of violence in the workplace."

     SECTION 3.  This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
