TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE ONE CALL CENTER.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Act 72, Session Laws of 2009, amended the definition of "excavation" to exempt certain activities of pest control operators licensed under chapter 460J, Hawaii Revised Statutes, from prohibitions of certain actions and reporting and other requirements by the one call center because pest control operators do not present the risks to underground facilities that the one call center was designed to address.  Although the exemption is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2012, the legislature finds that there have been no negative incidents as a result of this exemption and that this exemption should therefore be permanent.
     The purpose of this Act is to make permanent the exemption for certain activities of pest control operators from the definition of "excavation" under the one call center law.
     SECTION 2.  Act 72, Session Laws of Hawaii 2009, is amended by amending section 5 to read as follows:
     "SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect on June 29, 2009[; provided that section 2 of this Act be repealed on June 30, 2012 and section 269E-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, shall be reenacted in the form in which it read on June 28, 2009]."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on June 29, 2012.
