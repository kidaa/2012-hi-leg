STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE AUDITOR TO PERFORM A SUNRISE ANALYSIS OF THE REGULATION OF THE PROFESSION OF MUSIC THERAPY.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the American Music Therapy Association defines music therapy as the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program; and
 
     WHEREAS, research supports music therapy's effectiveness in areas such as physical rehabilitation, pain management, speech and communication development, social skills, cognitive processing and attention to task, behavioral needs, academic goals, treatment motivation, emotional support, and creative expression; and
 
     WHEREAS, music therapy has sixty years of clinical history in the United States and is recognized in Hawaii by the Departments of Health, Human Services, and Education; and
 
     WHEREAS, professional music therapists hold a bachelor's degree or higher level of study in music therapy from accredited colleges or universities; and
 
     WHEREAS, music therapists obtain the national credential Music Therapist-Board Certified from the Certification Board for Music Therapists, an independent, nonprofit corporation fully accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies, upon successful completion of:
 
     (1)  An approved academic and clinical training program; and
 
     (2)  A written objective national examination; and
 
     WHEREAS, after the assessment of the strengths and needs of each client, qualified board certified music therapists provide treatment and participate as members of an interdisciplinary team; and
 
     WHEREAS, consumers of music therapy services include children and adults with medical illnesses, psychiatric disorders, developmental disabilities, speech and hearing impairments, physical disabilities, and neurological impairments; and
 
     WHEREAS, music therapy is considered a related service under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act when deemed necessary to assist a child in benefiting from the child's special education; and
 
     WHEREAS, the profession of music therapy is separate and distinct from the profession of music education, as music therapists use music to address many of the goals targeted in an individualized education program such as:
 
     (1)  Learning of academic concepts;
 
     (2)  Increasing cooperation and appropriate social behavior;
 
     (3)  Providing avenues for communication;
 
     (4)  Increasing self-esteem and self-confidence;
 
     (5)  Improving motor responses and agility; and
 
     (6)  Encouraging exploration and examination of issues that impact the life of the individual; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Departments of Health and Education provide for allied health care interventions, early intervention, and special education related services, within a variety of health care and education settings but do not specifically include music therapy provided by a board certified music therapist; and
 
     WHEREAS, the children of Hawaii are currently denied access to music therapy services as a part of their individualized family service plan or individualized service plan; and
 
     WHEREAS, the lack of state credentialing of individuals to provide music therapy services does a disservice to the public; and
 
     WHEREAS, the establishment of a licensing program for unregulated professional board certified music therapists in Hawaii under the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs will provide necessary oversight; and
 
     WHEREAS, under section 26H-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, a sunrise analysis by the Auditor must occur prior to initiating the regulation of a profession; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Auditor is requested to perform an analysis of the proposed regulation of the profession of music therapy, as proposed in House Bill No.     (2012); and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor is requested to consult with the American Music Therapy Association; the Certification Board for Music Therapists; representatives of the credentialed music therapists in Hawaii; and Sounding Joy Music Therapy, Inc., a certified music therapy organization in Honolulu, in developing the sunrise analysis; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor is requested to set forth the probable effects of the proposed regulation and to assess whether the proposed regulation is consistent with the policies set forth in section 26H-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes and whether there are alternative appropriate forms of regulation; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor is requested to transmit findings of the sunrise analysis to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Director of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Auditor, Director of Health, Superintendent of Education, Director of Government Relations for the American Music Therapy Association, and the Regulatory Affairs Advisor for the Certification Board for Music Therapists.
