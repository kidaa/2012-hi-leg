A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO TAX APPEALS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the small claims procedure of the tax appeal court is intended to be an informal process.  Pursuant to section 232-5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the small claims procedure of the tax appeal court is established by rule rather than statute.
     The purpose of this Act is to direct the supreme court to amend the rules of the tax appeal court to prohibit pre-trial discovery and limit the award of costs in cases filed under the small claims procedure of the tax appeal court.
     SECTION 2.  The supreme court shall adopt rules pursuant to section 232-14, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to:
     (1)  Prohibit pre-trial discovery, including but not limited to depositions, interrogatories, and formal written disclosure of expert or other witnesses in appeals filed under the small claims procedure of the tax appeal court; and
     (2)  Limit the award of costs that may be awarded to the prevailing party in appeals filed under the small claims procedure of the tax appeal court to court filing fees.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
