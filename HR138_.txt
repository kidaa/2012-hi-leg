HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO CONVENE A LEGISLATIVE TASK FORCE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE POTENTIAL SALE OF THE TESORO OIL REFINERY ON CONSUMERS AND THE STATE.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the recent announcement regarding the sale of the Tesoro oil refinery has caused a great deal of concern regarding the economic impact on consumers and the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, this announcement comes at a time of positive, yet fragile, economic growth within the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, the sale, or inability to sell, the Tesoro oil refinery may have drastic effects on the financial well-being of consumers and the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is imperative that the Legislature understand the economic impacts of a sale of the Tesoro oil refinery on consumers and the State's economy; and
 
     WHEREAS, the State should be prepared to take all necessary steps to ensure that consumers are protected from skyrocketing oil prices that would threaten to cripple the recovering local economy; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Speaker of the House of Representatives is requested to convene a legislative task force of House members to assess the impact of the potential sale of the Tesoro oil refinery on consumers and the State; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force develop economic models that illustrate the potential economic effect that having a single oil refinery operating in the State would have as compared to having at least two oil refineries operating in the State; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force also develop an economic model that considers the economic impact to Hawaii consumers and the State if a natural or man-made event causes an oil refinery in the State to temporarily cease production; how petroleum products could be supplied under such a scenario; and the projected impact of such a scenario; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
