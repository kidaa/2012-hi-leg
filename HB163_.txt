     (3)  The benefits available under this plan, when combined with benefits available under medicare or any other coverage or plan to which this plan is subordinate under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' coordination of benefit rules, shall approximate the benefits that would be provided to a similarly situated employee-beneficiary not eligible for medicare;
     (4)  All employee-beneficiaries or dependent-beneficiaries who are eligible to enroll in the medicare part B medical insurance plan shall enroll in that plan as a condition of receiving contributions and participating in benefits plans under this chapter.  This paragraph shall apply to retired employees, their spouses[,] or reciprocal beneficiaries, and the surviving spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries of deceased retirees and employees killed in the performance of duty; and

     In the case of a married couple [filing] or parties in a reciprocal beneficiary relationship who file separate returns, the sum of the deductions allowable to each of them for the taxable year shall not exceed $5,000, or $10,000 for a joint return, for amounts paid in cash, excluding interest paid or accrued thereon.
     The amounts paid in cash allowable as a deduction under this section to an individual for all taxable years shall not exceed $25,000, excluding interest paid or accrued.  In the case of married individuals or reciprocal beneficiaries having separate individual housing accounts, the sum of the separate accounts and the deduction under this section shall not exceed $25,000, excluding interest paid or accrued thereon.
     (b)  For purposes of this section, the term "individual housing account" means a trust created or organized in Hawaii for the exclusive benefit of an individual, or, in the case of a married individual[,] or party to a reciprocal beneficiary relationship, for the exclusive benefit of the individual and spouse or reciprocal beneficiary jointly, but only if the written governing instrument creating the trust meets the following requirements:
     (1)  Contributions shall not be accepted for the taxable year in excess of $5,000 (or $10,000 in the case of a joint return) or in excess of $25,000 for all taxable years, exclusive of interest paid or accrued;
     (2)  The trustee is a bank, a savings and loan association, a credit union, or a depository financial services loan company, chartered, licensed, or supervised under federal or state law, whose accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, or any agency of this State or any federal agency established for the purpose of insuring accounts in these financial institutions.  The financial institution must actively make residential real estate mortgage loans in Hawaii;
     (3)  The assets of the trust shall be invested only in fully insured savings or time deposits.  Funds held in the trust may be commingled for purposes of investment, but individual records shall be maintained by the trustee for each individual housing account holder which show all transactions in detail;
     (4)  The entire interest of an individual [or], married couple, or reciprocal beneficiaries for whose benefit the trust is maintained shall be distributed to the individual [or], couple, or reciprocal beneficiaries not later than one hundred twenty months after the date on which the first contribution is made to the trust;
     (5)  Except as provided in subsection (g), the trustee shall not distribute the funds in the account unless it (A) verifies that the money is to be used for the purchase of a first principal residence located in Hawaii, and provides that the instrument of payment is payable to the mortgagor, construction contractor, or other vendor of the property purchased; or (B) withholds an amount equal to ten per cent of the amount withdrawn from the account and remits this amount to the director within ten days after the date of the withdrawal.  The amount so withheld shall be applied to the liability of the taxpayer under subsections (c) and (e); and
     (6)  If any amounts are distributed before the expiration of three hundred sixty-five days from the date on which a contribution is made to the account, the trustee shall so notify in writing the taxpayer and the director.  If the trustee makes the verification required in paragraph (5)(A), then the department shall disallow the deduction under subsection (a) and subsections (c), (e), and (f) shall not apply to that amount.  If the trustee withholds an amount under paragraph (5)(B), then the department shall disallow the deduction under subsection (a) and subsection (e) shall apply, but subsection (c) shall not apply."
      2.  By amending subsections (g) and (h) to read:
      "(g)  No tax liability shall be imposed under this section if:
     (1)  The payment or distribution is attributable to the individual dying or becoming totally disabled; or
     (2)  Residential property subject to subsection (f) is transferred by will or by operation of law or sold due to the death or total disability of an individual or an individual's spouse[,] or reciprocal beneficiary,
subject to the following:
     An individual shall not be considered to be totally disabled unless proof is furnished of the total disability in the form and manner as the director may require.
     Upon the death of an individual for whose benefit an individual housing account has been established, the funds in the account shall be payable to the estate of the individual; provided that if the account was held jointly by the decedent and a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary of the decedent, the account shall terminate and be paid to the surviving spouse[;] or reciprocal beneficiary; or, if the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary so elects, the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary may continue the account as an individual housing account.  Upon the total disability of an individual for whose benefit an individual housing account has been established, the individual or the individual's authorized representative may elect to continue the account or terminate the account and be paid the assets; provided that if the account was held jointly by a totally disabled person and a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary of that person, then the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, or an authorized representative of the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary may elect to continue the account or terminate the account and be paid the assets.
     (h)  If the individual for whose benefit the individual housing account was established subsequently marries a person or enters into a reciprocal beneficiary relationship with a person who has or has had any interest in residential property, the individual's housing account shall be terminated, the funds therein shall be distributed to the individual, and the amount of the funds shall be includable in the individual's gross income for the taxable year in which such marriage took place; provided that the tax liability defined under subsection (f) shall not be imposed."

     SECTION 19.  Section 235-55.6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows:
     1.   By amending subsection (b) to read:
     "(b)  Definitions of qualifying individual and employment- related expenses.  For purposes of this section:

     (2)  Married couples [must] and parties in a reciprocal beneficiary relationship shall file joint return.  If the taxpayer is married or a party in a reciprocal beneficiary relationship at the close of the taxable year, the credit shall be allowed under subsection (a) only if the taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary file a joint return for the taxable year.

     SECTION 22.  Section 235-61, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     1.  By amending subsection (c) to read:
     "(c)  For each withholding period (whether weekly, biweekly, monthly, or otherwise) the amount of tax to be withheld under this section shall be at a rate which, for the taxable year, will yield the tax imposed by section 235-51 upon each employee's annual wage, as estimated from the employee's current wage in any withholding period, but for the purposes of this subsection of the rates provided by section 235-51 the maximum to be taken into consideration shall be eight per cent.  The tax for the taxable year shall be calculated upon the following assumptions:
     (1)  That the employee's annual wage, as estimated from the employee's current wage in the withholding period, will be the employee's sole income for the taxable year;
     (2)  That there will be no deductions therefrom in determining adjusted gross income;
     (3)  That in determining taxable income there shall be a standard deduction allowance which shall be an amount equal to one exemption (or more than one exemption if so prescribed by the director) unless (A) the taxpayer is married or a party to a reciprocal beneficiary relationship and the taxpayer's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary is an employee receiving wages subject to withholding, or (B) the taxpayer has withholding exemption certificates in effect with respect to more than one employer.  For the purposes of this section, any standard deduction allowance under this paragraph shall be treated as if it were denominated a withholding exemption;
     (4)  That in determining taxable income there also will be deducted the amount of exemptions and withholding allowances granted to the employee in the computation of taxable income, as shown by a certificate to be filed with the employer as provided by subsection (f); and
     (5)  If it appears from the certificate filed pursuant to subsection (f) that the employee, under section 235-93, is entitled to make a joint return, that the employee and the employee's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary will so elect."
      2.  By amending subsections (f) and (g) to read:
     "(f)  On or before the date of the commencement of employment with an employer, the employee shall furnish the employer with a signed certificate relating to the number of exemptions which the employee claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which the employee is entitled on the basis of the existing facts, and also showing whether the employee is married or a party to a reciprocal beneficiary relationship and is, under section 235-93, entitled to make a joint return.  The certificate shall be in such form and contain such information as may be prescribed by the department.
     If, on any day during the calendar year, there is a change in the employee's marital or reciprocal beneficiary status and the employee no longer is entitled to make a joint return, or the number of exemptions to which the employee is entitled is less than the number of exemptions claimed by the employee on the certificate then in effect with respect to the employee, the employee shall within ten days thereafter furnish the employer with a new certificate showing the employee's present marital or reciprocal beneficiary status, or relating to the number of exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which the employee is entitled on the basis of the existing facts.  If, on any day during the calendar year, there is a change in the employee's marital or reciprocal beneficiary status and though previously not entitled to make a joint return the employee now is so entitled, or the number of exemptions to which the employee is entitled is greater than the number of exemptions claimed, the employee may furnish the employer with a new certificate showing the employee's present marital status, or relating to the number of exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which the employee is entitled on the basis of the existing facts.
     Such certificate shall take effect at the times set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.
     (g)  In determining the deduction allowed by subsection (c)(4) an employee shall be entitled to withholding allowances or additional reductions in withholding under this subsection.  In determining the number of additional withholding allowances or the amount of additional reductions in withholding under this subsection, the employee may take into account (to the extent and in the manner provided by rules) estimated itemized deductions and tax credits allowable under this chapter; and such additional deductions and other items as may be specified by the director in rules.  For the purposes of this subsection a fractional number shall not be taken into account unless it amounts to one-half or more, in which case it shall be increased to the next whole number.
     (1)  As used in this subsection, unless the context otherwise requires:
         (A)  "Estimated itemized deductions" means the aggregate amount which the employee reasonably expects will be allowed as deductions under sections 235-2.3, 235-2.4, 235-2.45, and 235-7, other than the deductions referred to in Internal Revenue Code section 151 and those deductions required to be taken into account in determining adjusted gross income under Internal Revenue Code section 62(a) (with the exception of paragraph 10 thereof) for the estimation year.  In no case shall the aggregate amount be greater than the sum of:
              (i)  The amount of the deductions reflected in the employee's net income tax return for the taxable year preceding the estimation year of (if a return has not been filed for the preceding taxable year at the time the withholding exemption certificate is furnished the employer) the second taxable year preceding the estimation year; or
             (ii)  The amount of estimated itemized deductions and tax credits allowable under this chapter and any additional deductions to which entitled; and
            (iii)  The amount of the employee's determinable additional deductions for the estimation year.
         (B)  "Estimated wages" means the aggregate amount which the employee reasonably expects will constitute wages for the estimation year;
         (C)  "Determinable additional deductions" means those estimated itemized deductions which:
              (i)  Are in excess of the deductions referred to in subparagraph (A) reflected on the employee's net income tax return for the taxable year preceding the estimation year; and
             (ii)  Are demonstrably attributable to an identifiable event during the estimation year or the preceding taxable year which can reasonably be expected to cause an increase in the amount of such deductions on the net income tax return for the estimation year.
         (D)  "Estimation year", in the case of an employee who files the employee's return on the basis of a calendar year, means the calendar year in which the wages are paid; provided that in the case of an employee who files the employee's return on a basis other than the calendar year, the employee's estimation year, and the amounts deducted and withheld to be governed by the estimation year, shall be determined under rules prescribed by the director of taxation.
     (2)  Under this subsection, the following special rules shall apply:
         (A)  Married individuals[.] or parties in a reciprocal beneficiary relationship.  The number of withholding allowances to which a husband and wife or reciprocal beneficiaries are entitled under this subsection shall be determined on the basis of their combined wages and deductions.  This subparagraph shall not apply to a husband and wife or reciprocal beneficiaries who filed separate returns for the taxable year preceding the estimation year and who reasonably expect to file separate returns for the estimation year;
         (B)  Limitation.  In the case of employees whose estimated wages are at levels at which the amounts deducted and withheld under this chapter generally are insufficient (taking into account a reasonable allowance for deductions and exceptions) to offset the liability for tax under this chapter with respect to the wages from which the amounts are deducted and withheld, the director may by rule reduce the withholding allowances to which those employees would, but for this subparagraph, be entitled under this subsection;
         (C)  Treatment of allowances.  For purposes of this chapter, any withholding allowance under this subsection shall be treated as if it were denominated a withholding exemption.
     (3)  The director may prescribe tables by rule under chapter 91 pursuant to which employees shall determine the number of withholding allowances to which they are entitled under this subsection."
     SECTION 23.  Section 235-93, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) and (b) to read as follows:
     "(a)  A husband and wife, having that status for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code and entitled to make a joint federal return for the taxable year, and reciprocal beneficiaries who entered into the reciprocal beneficiary relationship during or prior to the taxable year may make a single return jointly of taxes under this chapter for the taxable year.  In that case the tax shall be computed on their aggregate income as provided in section 235-52, and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.  For purposes of this chapter "aggregate income" means the income of both spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries without regard to source in the State.
     (b)  If an individual has filed a separate return for a taxable year for which a joint return could have been made by the taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse[,] or reciprocal beneficiary, an election thereafter to make a joint return for the taxable year shall be made only upon compliance with rules of the department of taxation, which may limit the election and prescribe the terms and provisions applicable in such cases as nearly as may be in conformity with the Internal Revenue Code."
     SECTION 24.  Section 235-102.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§235-102.5  Income check-off authorized.  (a)  Any individual whose state income tax liability for any taxable year is $3 or more may designate $3 of the liability to be paid over to the Hawaii election campaign fund, any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, when submitting a state income tax return to the department.  In the case of a joint return of a husband and wife or reciprocal beneficiaries having a state income tax liability of $6 or more, each spouse or reciprocal beneficiary may designate that $3 be paid to the fund.  The director of taxation shall revise the individual state income tax form to allow the designation of contributions to the fund on the face of the tax return and immediately above the signature lines.  An explanation shall be included which clearly states that the check-off does not constitute an additional tax liability.  If no designation was made on the original tax return when filed, a designation may be made by the individual on an amended return filed within twenty months and ten days after the due date for the original return for such taxable year.  A designation once made whether by an original or amended return may not be revoked.
     (b)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, any individual whose state income tax refund for any taxable year is $2 or more may designate $2 of the refund to be deposited into the school-level minor repairs and maintenance special fund established by section 302A-1504.5, when submitting a state income tax return to the department.  In the case of a joint return of a husband and wife or parties in a reciprocal beneficiary relationship having a state income tax refund of $4 or more, each spouse or reciprocal beneficiary may designate that $2 be deposited into the special fund.  The director of taxation shall revise the individual state income tax return form to allow the designation of contributions to the special fund on the face of the tax return and immediately above the signature lines.  If no designation was made on the original tax return when filed, a designation may be made by the individual on an amended return filed within twenty months and ten days after the due date for the original return for such taxable year.  A designation once made, whether by an original or amended return, may not be revoked.
     (c)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, any individual whose state income tax refund for any taxable year is $2 or more may designate $2 of the refund to be paid over to the libraries special fund established by section 312-3.6, when submitting a state income tax return to the department.  In the case of a joint return of a husband and wife or parties in a reciprocal beneficiary relationship having a state income tax refund of $4 or more, each spouse or reciprocal beneficiary may designate that $2 be deposited into the special fund.  The director of taxation shall revise the individual state income tax form to allow the designation of contributions to the fund on the face of the tax return and immediately above the signature lines.  If no designation was made on the original tax return when filed, a designation may be made by the individual on an amended return filed within twenty months and ten days after the due date for the original return for such taxable year.  A designation once made, whether by an original or amended return, may not be revoked.
     (d)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, any individual whose state income tax refund for any taxable year is $5 or more may designate $5 of the refund to be paid over as follows:
     (1)  One-third to the Hawaii children's trust fund under section 350B-2; and
     (2)  Two-thirds to be divided equally among:
         (A)  The domestic violence and sexual assault special fund under the department of health in section 321-1.3;
         (B)  The spouse and child abuse special account under the department of human services in section 346‑7.5; and
         (C)  The spouse and child abuse special account under the judiciary in section 601-3.6.
When designated by a taxpayer submitting a state income tax return to the department, the department of budget and finance shall allocate the moneys among the several funds as provided in this subsection.  In the case of a joint return of a husband and wife or parties in a reciprocal beneficiary relationship having a state income tax refund of $10 or more, each spouse or reciprocal beneficiary may designate that $5 be paid over as provided in this subsection.  The director of taxation shall revise the individual state income tax form to allow the designation of contributions pursuant to this subsection on the face of the tax return and immediately above the signature lines.  If no designation was made on the original tax return when filed, a designation may be made by the individual on an amended return filed within twenty months and ten days after the due date for the original return for such taxable year.  A designation once made, whether by an original or amended return, may not be revoked."
     SECTION 25.  Section 235-110.6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:
     "(c)  The tax credit claimed under this section by the principal operator shall be deductible from the principal operator's individual or corporate income tax liability, if any, for the tax year in which the credit is properly claimed; provided that a husband and wife or parties in a reciprocal beneficiary relationship filing separate returns for a taxable year for which a joint return could have been made by them shall claim only the tax credit to which they would have been entitled had a joint return been filed.  If the tax credit claimed by the principal operator under this section exceeds the amount of the income tax payments due from the principal operator, the excess of credit over payments due shall be refunded to the principal operator from the state highway fund; provided that the tax credit properly claimed by a principal operator who has no income tax liability shall be paid to the principal operator from the state highway fund; and provided further no refunds or payments on account of the tax credit allowed by this section shall be made for amounts less than $1."
     SECTION 26.  Part XIV, chapter 346, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§346-     Community care foster family homes; reciprocal beneficiaries.  Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, two, private-pay clients who are in a reciprocal beneficiary relationship with each other may be cared for in the same community care foster family home if:
     (1)  The community care foster family home is certified for three beds;
     (2)  Operators of three-bed community care foster family homes shall provide written notice to the department of any vacancy within five business days of the vacancy;
     (3)  The community care foster family home has had a vacancy in the third bed for at least six consecutive months; provided that this requirement may be waived under conditions established by the department;
     (4)  One of the individuals in the reciprocal beneficiary relationship has been in residence at the community care foster family home for less than five consecutive years; and
     (5)  The reciprocal beneficiary resident provides medical documentation that a medical condition prevents the individual from being moved from the community care foster family home."
PART II
     SECTION 27.  Section 572-1.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:"
     "[[]§572-1.5[]]  Definition of marriage.  Whenever used in the statutes or other laws of Hawaii, "marriage" means the union of one man and one woman as husband and wife who are licensed under section 572-1."
     SECTION 28.  If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the Act, which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable.
     SECTION 29.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
