A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE KAANAPALI AQUATIC RECREATIONAL PARK.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that increased recreational and commercial activities in Hawaii's nearshore waters have led to safety concerns and, in some cases, tragic results.  In December 2011, a well-respected canoe regatta official died after being struck by a recreational watercraft in waters near Wahikuli Wayside park on the island of Maui, an area popular with divers, swimmers, and other recreational ocean users.
     SECTION 2.  Not later than January 1, 2013, the department of land and natural resources shall establish and administer an aquatic recreational park pilot program in Kaanapali on the island of Maui.  The pilot program shall designate an area of Kaanapali ocean waters for non-motorized recreational activities, including but not limited to swimming, surfing, snorkeling, paddling, canoeing, and sailing.
     SECTION 3.  The department of land and natural resources shall submit a report to the legislature regarding the boundaries and status of the aquatic recreational park pilot program and make findings and recommendations, including whether to continue the pilot program, not later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2014.  The report shall include any pertinent information, recommendations, or proposed legislation, if any, to determine whether the aquatic recreational park pilot program should be extended to other coastal recreation areas throughout the State.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval only if H.B. No.    , Relating to the West Maui Ocean Recreation Management Area, is passed in any form by the legislature, regular session of 2012; provided that this Act shall be repealed on June 30, 2014.
