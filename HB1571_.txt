STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO AGRICULTURE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's agricultural industry is an important and vital part of its overall economy.  In order to continue to support and expand the agricultural sector, the State must continuously invest in the basic infrastructure that serves thousands of acres of agricultural lands.  It is important that the State continue to invest in the capital improvement of the irrigation system to deliver water effectively to farmers and ranchers.
     The legislature finds that one of the most important irrigation systems in the State is the Waiahole irrigation system.  The Waiahole irrigation system is a one-hundred-year-old, 25.3-mile-long system in serious need of repair to ensure that water continues to be delivered efficiently to farmers and ranchers.  The Waiahole irrigation system services thousands of acres of productive agricultural lands in central Oahu.
     The purpose of this Act is to support agriculture in Hawaii by issuing general obligation bonds for capital improvements to the Waiahole irrigation system, including siphon replacements and other necessary infrastructure.
     SECTION 2.  The director of finance is authorized to issue general obligation bonds in the sum of $2,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary is appropriated for fiscal year 2011-2012 for the purpose of making capital improvements to the Waiahole irrigation system, including siphon replacements and other necessary infrastructure, as follows:
     Plans                                   $250,000
     Design                                  $250,000
     Construction                          $1,500,000
     Total funding                         $2,000,000
     SECTION 3.  The appropriation made for the capital improvement projects authorized by this Act shall not lapse at the end of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made; provided that all moneys from the appropriation unencumbered as of June 30, 2014, shall lapse as of that date.
     SECTION 4.  The sum appropriated for the respective capital improvement projects set forth in section 2 of this Act shall be expended by the department of agriculture for the purpose of this Act.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
