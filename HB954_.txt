     (1)  Where the child is physically or mentally unable to attend school (deafness and blindness excepted), of which fact the certificate of a duly licensed physician shall be sufficient evidence;

     (4)  Where the child has graduated from high school;
     (5)  Where the child is enrolled in an appropriate alternative educational program as approved by the superintendent or the superintendent's authorized representative in accordance with the plans and policies of the department, or notification of intent to home school has been submitted to the principal of the public school that the child would otherwise be required to attend in accordance with department rules adopted to achieve this result; or
     (6)  Where:
         (A)  The child has attained the age of sixteen years;
         (B)  The principal has determined that:
              (i)  The child has engaged in behavior which is disruptive to other students, teachers, or staff; or
             (ii)  The child's non-attendance is chronic and has become a significant factor that hinders the child's learning; and
         (C)  The principal of the child's school, and the child's teacher or counselor, in consultation with the child and the child's parent, guardian, or other adult having legal responsibility for or care of the child, develops an alternative educational plan for the child.  The alternative educational plan shall include a process that shall permit the child to resume school.
          The principal of the child's school shall file the plan made pursuant to subparagraph (C) with the child's school record.  If the adult having legal responsibility for or care of the child disagrees with the plan, then the adult shall be responsible for obtaining appropriate educational services for the child."
     SECTION 2.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
