HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING A SUNRISE REVIEW OF REGULATIONS FOR ZIPLINES AND CANOPY TOURS.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, ziplines and canopy tours are a unique and exciting way to experience the beauty of Hawaii's natural landscape; and
 
     WHEREAS, there are ziplines or canopy tours on most islands, including Hawaii Island, Maui, Oahu, and Kauai where locals and tourists alike can experience the thrill of soaring above the trees and over such natural wonders as waterfalls and gullies; and
 
     WHEREAS, ziplines and canopy tours are among the fastest growing segments of the State's activities and attractions, providing a distinctive experience for those who visit the islands and bring memories home; and
 
     WHEREAS, ziplines and canopy tours are inherently dangerous, with several mechanical functions that require close supervision and fastidious attention to detail; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is imperative that the State ensure the safety and well-being of those who enjoy Hawaii's scenic landscape via ziplines and canopy tours offered throughout the islands; and
 
     WHEREAS, ziplines and canopy tours can be safe and easily used, but operators and employees must be adequately trained and infrastructure must be properly maintained; and
 
     WHEREAS, regulations for ziplines and canopy tours have already been established by two trade groups in the United States--the Association for Challenge Course Technology and the Professional Ropes Course Association; and      WHEREAS, section 26H-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), requires a review by the Auditor prior to the enactment of a measure that would subject an unregulated profession or vocation to licensing or other regulatory control; and
 
     WHEREAS, House Bill No. 2060, introduced in the Regular Session of 2012, proposes regulations for ziplines and canopy tours which are currently unregulated; and
 
     WHEREAS, House Bill No. 2060 called upon the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations boiler and elevator inspectors to conduct the inspections of ziplines and canopy tours; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations testified at the public hearing on House Bill No. 2060 that its boiler and elevator inspectors do not have the expertise to administer inspections of ziplines and canopy tours; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs also testified at the public hearing on House Bill No. 2060 and questioned which agency is the proper authority to inspect ziplines and canopy tours and enforce regulations; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Auditor is requested to perform a sunrise review on the regulation of ziplines and canopy tours as proposed in House Bill No. 2060, Regular Session of 2012, including an assessment of alternative forms of regulation, pursuant to section 26H-6, HRS; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor specifically address the issues of inspectors and inspector qualifications raised by the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations and the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in testimony on House Bill No. 2060; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor is requested to submit findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature not later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Auditor.
