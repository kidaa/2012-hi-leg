HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TO CONVENE A TASK FORCE TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLE ACCIDENTS ON CHILDREN.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the popularity of all-terrain vehicles, commonly known as ATV's, has grown in recent years; and
 
     WHEREAS, all-terrain vehicle rollovers, collisions, and ejections can cause serious or fatal injuries; and
 
     WHEREAS, according to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, there were 9,633 ATV-related deaths reported nationally between 1982 and 2008, with fourteen of those deaths occurring in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, all-terrain vehicles are particularly dangerous for minors, as children younger than sixteen accounted for an estimated sixteen per cent of all ATV-related deaths in 2009; and
 
     WHEREAS, the overrepresentation of children in the ATV-related injury and death statistics have led the American Academy of Pediatrics to recommend that no one under the age of sixteen should be authorized to operate all-terrain vehicles; and
 
     WHEREAS, a review of the impact of ATV-related accidents on children will help the State better understand the problem and find ways to avoid injuries and death; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Transportation is requested to convene a task force to examine the impact of all-terrain vehicle accidents on children; and

     (1)  The Director of Transportation, or the Director's designee;

     (3)  The Director of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism, or the Director's designee;

     (5)  A representative from the United States Product Safety Commission;
 
     (6)  A representative from the American Academy of Pediatrics; and

     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Director of Transportation is requested to serve as chairperson of the task force; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force is requested to submit to the Legislature a report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Transportation, the Director of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, the Director of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism, the Director of Health, the Chairperson of the United States Product Safety Commission, and the President of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
