TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that many problems associated with the use of methamphetamines continue to persist in spite of efforts by the State and the federal government to control the production, use, and sale of this harmful drug.  The legislature further finds that Oregon and Mississippi have passed legislation that requires a prescription for the purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine, which can be used to manufacture crystal methamphetamine.  According to a November 15, 2010, article in the New York Times, in Oregon, this legislation has contributed to "the steepest decline in crime rates in the 50 states" and "the number of meth labs in [Mississippi] has fallen by 65 percent." 
     The purpose of this Act is to require a prescription for the purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine in order to reduce the risk to public health caused by the illegal manufacture, use, and sale of crystal methamphetamine.
     SECTION 2.  Section 329-16, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (f) to read as follows:
     "(f)  Immediate precursor.  Unless listed in another schedule, any material, compound, mixture, or preparation [which] that contains any quantity of the following substances:
     (1)  Immediate [precursor] precursors to amphetamine and methamphetamine:
         (A)  Phenylacetone, phenyl-2-propanone(P2P), benzyl methyl ketone, methyl benzyl ketone [or]; and
         (B)  Pseudoephedrine; or
     (2)  Immediate precursors to phencyclidine (PCP):
         (A)  1-phenylcyclohexylamine; and
         (B)  1-piperidinocyclohexanecarbonitrile(PCC)."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
