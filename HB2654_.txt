TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND CABLE TELEVISION SERVICES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

PART I
     SECTION 1.  The State of Hawaii recognizes that advanced broadband services are essential infrastructure for an innovation economy and a knowledge society in the twenty-first century.  High speed broadband services at affordable prices are necessary for the advancement of education, health, research and innovation, civic participation, e-government, economic development and diversification, and public safety and services.  The State also recognizes evolution of the manner in which communications and information services are delivered to the consumer, including by wireline, wireless, cable television, and satellite infrastructures, and that voice, video, and data services provided by these infrastructures are converging.  In order to position Hawaii for global competitiveness in the twenty-first century, this Act promotes the following goals:
     (1)  Access to broadband communications for all persons in the State by 2015 at speeds and prices comparable to the average available in the top three performing countries in the world;
     (2)  Availability of broadband communications services on a competitive basis to reduce prices, increase service penetration, and improve service to all persons in the State;
     (3)  Increased broadband availability at affordable cost to low income and other disadvantaged groups;
     (4)  Increased sharing of broadband infrastructure to reduce provider costs and customer prices, encourage deployment, and ease entry into a competitive broadband marketplace;
     (5)  Increased, flexible, timely, and responsible access to public rights-of-way and public facilities for broadband service providers; and
     (6)  A more streamlined permit approval process that incorporates the input of stakeholders and other interested parties.
     This Act creates the Hawaii communications commission ("commission") and tasks it with investigating, promoting, and ensuring the growth and development of broadband infrastructure within the State in accord with these goals.  Under this Act, the commission's role is to "champion" the State's broadband, telecommunications, and video programming services interests before the federal government, including Congress, the executive branch, and the Federal Communications Commission and state and local agencies, including the governor, the state legislature, and county governments.  While fulfilling this role, this Act requires the commission to maintain close working relationships with community groups, civic associations, industry trade organizations, industry leaders, and other stakeholders to ensure that the State's interests and concerns are understood.
     Under this Act, the commission is required to:
     (1)  Develop state policies relating to the provision of broadband communications services and interstate and international communications services and facilities serving or transiting the State of Hawaii;
     (2)  Work with other governmental entities to investigate measures including standardization, consolidation, and coordination that can be taken to streamline and expedite permitting and approval processes for the construction of additional broadband infrastructure; and
     (3)  Develop and implement initiatives and programs to construct or otherwise make available additional infrastructure for the provision of broadband services, and the sharing of such infrastructure by competing providers of broadband services to the public.
     This Act also consolidates the regulation of telecommunications carriers and cable operators in the State under the commission.  In doing so, the Act creates a "one stop shop" to assist businesses providing broadband, telecommunications, and video programming services, and expediting the process for them to make their services rapidly available to the public.  Consolidating and streamlining the State's regulatory processes for the telecommunications sector in the State will help to facilitate the construction of telecommunications and broadband infrastructure and the introduction, penetration, and capability of advanced broadband communications services.
     The public utilities commission currently regulates telecommunications carriers pursuant to chapter 269 and the director of commerce and consumer affairs currently regulates cable operators pursuant to chapter 440G of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.
     This Act extracts the telecommunications provisions from chapter 269 and all of chapter 440G of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.  The Act removes authority from the director of commerce and consumer affairs to regulate cable operators and, following a one-year transition period, removes authority from the public utilities commission to regulate telecommunications carriers.  The commission is established to regulate both telecommunications carriers and cable operators, and is established within the department of business, economic development, and tourism.
     This Act requires the commission to examine promptly rate regulation for telecommunications carriers, including alternatives such as price cap regulation.  The Act also directs the commission to investigate the possibility of implementing incentive regulation for telecommunications carriers in order to increase investment in broadband infrastructure within the State.  This Act also provides for transitional provisions that assure that there is no gap in regulatory authority caused by the transition, if and until, the commission takes appropriate action to change existing rules, decisions, and other determinations.  Finally, this Act makes conforming amendments to other provisions of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.

     §   -16  Right to be represented by counsel.  At any investigation by or proceeding before the commission the telecommunications carrier, cable operator, PEG access organization, or the person concerned, or other respondent or party and any complainant or permitted intervenor shall have the right to be present and represented by counsel, to present any evidence desired, and to cross-examine any witness who may be called.
     §   -17  Commission may institute proceedings to enforce chapter.  (a)  If the commission is of the opinion that any telecommunications carrier, cable operator, PEG access organization, or any person is violating or failing to comply with any provision of this chapter or of any rule, order, or other requirement of the commission, or of any provisions of its certificate of public convenience and necessity, franchise, charter, contract, or articles of association, if any, or that changes, additions, extensions, or repairs are desirable in its plant or service to meet the reasonable convenience or necessity of the public, or to ensure greater safety or security, or that any rates, fares, classifications, charges, or rules are unreasonable or unreasonably discriminatory, or that in any way it is doing what it ought not to do, or not doing what it ought to do, the commission shall in writing inform the telecommunications carrier, cable operator, PEG access organization, or the person and may institute such proceedings as may be necessary to require the telecommunications carrier, cable operator, PEG access organization, or the person to correct any such deficiency.  In such event, the commission may by order direct the consumer advocate to appear in the proceeding, to carry out the purposes of this section.  The commission may examine into any of the matters referred to in section    -11, notwithstanding that the same may be within the jurisdiction of any court or other body; provided that this section shall not be construed as in any manner limiting or otherwise affecting the jurisdiction of any court or other body.  The commission may also revoke or amend any provision of a certificate of public convenience and necessity, franchise, charter, or articles of association, if any, pursuant to sections    -31 or    -68.
     (b)  In addition to any other remedy available, the commission or its enforcement officer may issue citations to any person acting in the capacity of or engaging in the business of a telecommunications carrier or cable operator within the State, without having a certificate of public convenience and necessity, franchise, or other authority previously obtained under and in compliance with this chapter or the rules adopted thereunder.

     (3)  If the person cited under this subsection does not submit a written request to the commission for a hearing within twenty calendar days from the receipt of the citation, the citation shall be deemed a final order of the commission.  The commission may apply to the appropriate court for a judgment to enforce the provisions of any final order issued by the commission pursuant to this subsection, including but not limited to the provisions for abatement and civil penalties imposed.  In any proceeding to enforce the provisions of the final order of the commission, the commission need only show that the notice was given, a hearing was held or the time granted for requesting the hearing has run without such a request, and a certified copy of the final order of the commission.
     (4)  If any party is aggrieved by the decision of the commission or the designated hearings officer, the party may appeal to the State intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the manner provided for civil appeals from the circuit court; provided that the operation of an abatement order shall not be stayed on appeal unless specifically ordered by the intermediate appellate court after applying the stay criteria enumerated in section 91-14(c).  The sanctions and disposition authorized under this subsection shall be separate and in addition to all other remedies either civil or criminal provided in any other applicable statutory provision.  The commission may adopt rules under chapter 91 as may be necessary to fully effectuate this subsection.

     §   -19  Alternative dispute resolution.  The commission may require the parties in any matter before the commission to participate in nonbinding arbitration, mediation, or other alternative dispute resolution process prior to the hearing.

     (b)  Each telecommunications carrier paying a fee under subsection (a) may impose a surcharge to recover the amount paid above one-eighth of one per cent of gross income.  The surcharge imposed shall not be subject to the notice, hearing, and approval requirements of this chapter; provided that the surcharge may be imposed by the telecommunications carrier only after thirty days' notice to the commission.
     §   -24  Consumer advocate.  The commission shall recognize the director as the consumer advocate in hearings and proceedings before the commission.
     §   -25  Communications advisory committee.  There is established the communications advisory committee.  The committee shall consist of five members appointed by the governor as provided in section 26-34.  The committee shall advise the commission, telecommunications carriers, and cable operators on matters within the jurisdiction of this chapter at the request of the commission or any telecommunications carrier or cable operator.  The members of the committee shall serve without pay but shall be entitled to reimbursement for necessary expenses while attending meetings and while in discharge of their duties.
     §   -26  Penalties.  (a)  Any telecommunications carrier, cable operator, or PEG access organization violating or failing in any particular way to conform to or comply with this chapter or any lawful order of the commission, including, but not limited to the acts specified in section    -68 for cable operators and PEG access organizations, shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 for each day the violation, neglect, or failure continues, to be assessed by the commission after a hearing in accordance with chapter 91.  The commission may order any offender to cease carrying on its business while the violation, neglect, or failure continues.
     (b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), any person acting in the capacity of or engaging in the business of a telecommunications carrier or a cable operator in the State without having a certificate of public convenience and necessity, franchise, or other authority previously obtained under and in compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted thereunder may be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each offense, and, in the case of a continuing violation, $5,000 for each day the uncertified or unfranchised activity continues.
     (c)  Upon written application filed within fifteen calendar days after service of an order imposing a civil penalty pursuant to this section, the commission may remit or mitigate the penalty upon terms as it deems proper.
     (d)  If any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this section is not paid within a period as the commission may direct, the attorney general may institute a civil action for recovery of the same in circuit court.

PART II.  TELECOMMUNICATIONS
     §   -31  Certificates of public convenience and necessity.  (a)  No telecommunications carrier, as defined in section    -1, shall commence its business without first having obtained from the commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity.  Applications for certificates shall be made in writing to the commission and shall comply with the requirements prescribed in the commission's rules.  The application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall include the type of service to be performed, the geographical scope of the operation, the type of equipment to be employed in the service, the name of competing telecommunications carriers for the proposed service, a statement of the applicant's financial ability to render the proposed service, a current financial statement of the applicant, and the rates or charges proposed to be charged including the rules governing the proposed service.
     (b)  A certificate shall be issued to any qualified applicant, authorizing the whole or any part of the operations covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is fit, willing, and able properly to perform the service proposed and to conform to the terms, conditions, and rules adopted by the commission, and that the proposed service is, or will be, required by the present or future public convenience and necessity; otherwise, the application shall be denied.  Any certificate issued shall specify the services to be rendered and there shall be attached to the exercise of the privileges granted by the certificate at the time of issuance and from time to time thereafter, reasonable conditions and limitations as the public convenience and necessity may require.  The reasonableness of the rates, charges, and tariff rules proposed by the applicant shall be determined by the commission during the same proceeding examining the present and future conveniences and needs of the public and qualifications of the applicant, in accordance with the standards set forth in section    ‑38.
     (c)  No telecommunications carrier that holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity, franchise, or charter enacted or granted by the legislative or executive authority of the State or its predecessor governments, or that has a bona fide operation as a telecommunications carrier heretofore recognized by the public utilities commission prior to July 1, 2013, shall be required to obtain a new certificate of public convenience and necessity under this section.
     (d)  Any certificate, upon application of the holder and at the discretion of the commission, may be amended, suspended, or revoked, in whole or in part.  The commission after notice and hearing may suspend, amend, or revoke any certificate in part or in whole, if the holder is found to be in willful violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or with any lawful order or rule of the commission adopted thereunder, or with any term, condition, or limitation of the certificate.
     §   -32  Location of records.  A telecommunications carrier shall keep and maintain records, books, papers, accounts, and other documents that the commission determines are necessary and shall make them immediately available when requested by the commission; provided that the original copies shall be made available when requested by the commission.
     §   -33  Annual financial reports.  All annual financial reports required to be filed with the commission by telecommunications carriers shall include a certification that the report conforms with the applicable uniform system of accounts adopted by the commission.  The commission shall adopt a uniform system of accounts for this purpose.
     §   -34  Telecommunications providers and services.  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the commission, upon its own motion or upon the application of any person, and upon notice and hearing, may exempt a telecommunications carrier or a telecommunications service from any or all of the provisions of this chapter, except the requirements of section    -36, upon a determination that the exemption is in the public interest.  In determining whether an exemption is in the public interest, the commission shall consider whether the exemption promotes state policies in telecommunications, the development, maintenance, and operation of effective and economically efficient telecommunications services, and the furnishing of telecommunications services at just and reasonable rates and in a fair manner in view of the needs of the various customer segments of the telecommunications industry.  Among the specific factors the commission may consider are:
     (1)  The appropriateness of the exemption in view of changes in the structure and technology of the State's telecommunications industry;
     (2)  The benefits accruing to the customers and users of the exempt telecommunications carrier or service;
     (3)  The impact of the exemption on the quality, efficiency, and availability of telecommunications services;
     (4)  The impact of the exemption on the maintenance of fair, just, and reasonable rates for telecommunications services;
     (5)  The likelihood of prejudice or disadvantage to ratepayers of basic local exchange service resulting from the exemption;
     (6)  The effect of the exemption on the preservation and promotion of affordable, universal, basic telecommunications services as those services are determined by the commission;
     (7)  The resulting subsidization, if any, of the exempt telecommunications service or provider by nonexempt services;
     (8)  The impact of the exemption on the availability of diversity in the supply of telecommunications services throughout the State;
     (9)  The improvements in the regulatory system to be gained from the exemption, including the reduction in regulatory delays and costs;
    (10)  The impact of the exemption on promoting innovations in telecommunications services;
    (11)  The opportunity provided by the exemption for telecommunications carriers to respond to competition;
    (12)  The potential for the exercise of substantial market power by the exempt provider or by a provider of the exempt telecommunications service; and
    (13)  The impact of the exemption on the competitive availability and affordability of broadband and other advanced services to consumers.
     (b)  The commission shall expedite, where practicable, the regulatory process with respect to exemptions and shall adopt guidelines under which each provider of an exempted service shall be subject to similar terms and conditions.
     (c)  The commission may condition or limit any exemption as the commission deems necessary in the public interest.  The commission may provide a trial period for any exemption and may terminate the exemption or continue it for such period and under such conditions and limitations as it deems appropriate.
     (d)  The commission may require a telecommunications provider to apply for a certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to section    -31; provided that the commission may waive any application requirement whenever it deems the waiver to be in furtherance of the purposes of this section.  The exemptions under this section may be granted in a proceeding for certification or in a separate proceeding.
     (e)  The commission may waive other regulatory requirements under this chapter applicable to telecommunications carriers when it determines that competition will serve the same purpose as public interest regulation.
     (f)  If any provider of an exempt telecommunications service or any exempt telecommunications carrier elects to terminate its service, it shall provide notice of this to its customers, the commission, and every telecommunications carrier providing basic local exchange service in this State.  The notice shall be in writing and given not less than six months before the intended termination date.  Upon termination of service by a provider of an exempt service or by an exempt provider, the appropriate telecommunications carrier providing basic local exchange service shall ensure that all customers affected by the termination receive basic local exchange service.  The commission shall, upon notice and hearing or by rule, determine the party or parties who shall bear the cost, if any, of access to the basic local exchange service by the customers of the terminated exempt service.
     (g)  Upon the petition of any person or upon its own motion, the commission may rescind any exemption or waiver granted under this section if, after notice and hearing, it finds that the conditions prompting the granting of the exemption or waiver no longer apply, or that the exemption or waiver is no longer in the public interest, or that the telecommunications carrier has failed to comply with one or more of the conditions of the exemption or applicable statutory or regulatory requirements.
     (h)  For purposes of this section, the commission, upon determination that any area of the State has less than adequate telecommunications service, shall require the existing telecommunications carrier to show cause as to why the commission should not authorize an alternative telecommunications carrier for that area under the terms and conditions of this section.
     §   -35  Application of this chapter.  This chapter shall not apply to commerce with foreign nations, or commerce with the several states of the United States, except insofar as the same may be permitted under the Constitution and laws of the United States; nor shall it apply to telecommunications carriers owned and operated by the State.
     §   -36  Obligations of telecommunications carriers.  In accordance with conditions and guidelines established by the commission to facilitate the introduction of competition into the State's telecommunications marketplace, each telecommunications carrier, upon bona fide request, shall provide services or information services, on reasonable terms and conditions, to an entity seeking to provide intrastate telecommunications, including but not limited to:
     (1)  Interconnection to the telecommunications carrier's telecommunications facilities at any technically feasible and economically reasonable point within the telecommunications carrier's network so that the networks are fully interoperable;
     (2)  The current interstate tariff used as the access rate until such time that the commission may adopt a new intrastate local service interconnection tariff pursuant to section    -37;
     (3)  Nondiscriminatory and equal access to any telecommunications carrier's telecommunications facilities, functions, and the information necessary to the transmission and routing of any telecommunications service and the interoperability of both carriers' networks;
     (4)  Nondiscriminatory access among all telecommunications carriers, where technically feasible and economically reasonable, and where safety or the provision of existing electrical service is not at risk, to the poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way owned or controlled by the telecommunications carrier, or the commission shall authorize access to electric utilities' poles as provided by the joint pole agreement, commission tariffs, rules, or orders, or Federal Communications Commission rules and regulations;
     (5)  Nondiscriminatory access to the network functions of the telecommunications carrier's telecommunications network, that shall be offered on an unbundled, competitively neutral, and cost-based basis;
     (6)  Telecommunications services and network functions without unreasonable restrictions on the resale or sharing of those services and functions; and
     (7)  Nondiscriminatory access of customers to the telecommunications carrier of their choice without the need to dial additional digits or access codes, where technically feasible.  The commission shall determine the equitable distribution of costs among the authorized telecommunications carriers that will use the access and shall establish rules to ensure access.
     Where possible, telecommunications carriers shall enter into negotiations to agree on the provision of services or information services without requiring intervention by the commission; provided that any such agreement shall be subject to review by the commission to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section.
     §   -37  Compensation agreements.  The commission shall ensure that telecommunications carriers are compensated on a fair basis for termination of telecommunications services on each other's networks, taking into account, among other things, reasonable and necessary costs to each telecommunications carrier of providing the services in question.  Telecommunications carriers may negotiate compensation arrangements that may include "bill and keep", mutual and equal compensation, or any other reasonable division of revenues pending tariff access rates to be set by the commission.  Upon failure of the negotiations, the commission shall determine the proper methodology and amount of compensation.
     §   -38  Regulation of telecommunications carrier rates; ratemaking procedures.  (a)  All rates, fares, charges, classifications, schedules, rules, and practices made, charged, or observed by any telecommunications carrier or by two or more telecommunications carriers jointly shall be just and reasonable and shall be filed with the commission.  The rates, fares, classifications, charges, and rules of every telecommunications carrier shall be published by the telecommunications carrier in such manner as the commission may require, and copies shall be furnished to any person on request.
     (b)  The commission shall promptly examine rate regulation alternatives including rate-of-return ratemaking and price cap ratemaking, and may issue an order imposing alternative rate regulation procedures.  The examination shall include pursuing incentive regulation with local exchange carriers, one goal of which shall be to increase broadband competitive availability and affordability to consumers in the State.
     (c)  The commission may waive rate regulation and allow telecommunications carriers to have pricing flexibility for services that the commission determines to be effectively competitive; provided that the rates for:
     (1)  Basic telephone service and for services that are not effectively competitive are regulated and remain just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory; and
     (2)  Universal service is preserved and advanced.
     (d)  Unless otherwise directed by the commission, a telecommunications carrier may charge any rate for a service less than or equal to the rate for the service included in the telecommunications carrier's filed tariff.  The rate charged shall be available at the same terms for all customers in all geographic locations within the telecommunications carrier's service area.
     (e)  Unless and until the commission waives this requirement, no rate, fare, charge, classification, schedule, rule, or practice, other than one established pursuant to an automatic rate adjustment clause previously approved by the commission, shall be established, abandoned, modified, or departed from by any telecommunications carrier, except after thirty days' notice to the commission as prescribed in section    ‑15(b), and prior approval by the commission for any increases in rates, fares, or charges.  The commission, in its discretion and for good cause shown, may allow any rate, fare, charge, classification, schedule, rule, or practice to be established, abandoned, modified, or departed from upon notice less than that provided for in section    ‑15(b).  Unless and until the commission waives this requirement, a contested case hearing shall be held in connection with any increase in rates, and the hearing shall be preceded by a public hearing as prescribed in section    ‑15(c), at which the consumers or patrons of the telecommunications carrier may present testimony to the commission concerning the increase.  The commission, upon notice to the telecommunications carrier, may:
     (1)  Suspend the operation of all or any part of the proposed rate, fare, charge, classification, schedule, rule, or practice or any proposed abandonment or modification thereof or departure therefrom;
     (2)  After a hearing, by order:
         (A)  Regulate, fix, and change all rates, fares, charges, classifications, schedules, rules, and practices so that the same shall be just and reasonable;
         (B)  Prohibit rebates and unreasonable discrimination between localities or between users or consumers under substantially similar conditions;
         (C)  Regulate the manner in which the property of every telecommunications carrier is operated with reference to the safety and accommodation of the public;
         (D)  Prescribe its form and method of keeping accounts, books, and records, and its accounting system;
         (E)  Regulate the return upon its telecommunications carrier property;
         (F)  Regulate the incurring of indebtedness relating to its telecommunications carrier business; and
         (G)  Regulate its financial transactions; and
     (3)  Do all things that are necessary and in the exercise of the commission's power and jurisdiction, all of which as so ordered, regulated, fixed, and changed are just and reasonable, and provide a fair return on the property of the telecommunications carrier actually used or useful for telecommunications carrier purposes.
     (f)  The commission in its discretion, after public hearing and upon showing by a telecommunications carrier of probable entitlement and financial need, may authorize temporary increases in rates, fares, and charges; provided that the commission shall require by order the telecommunications carrier to return, in the form of an adjustment to rates, fares, or charges to be billed in the future, any amounts with interest, at a rate equal to the rate of return on the telecommunications carrier's rate base found to be reasonable by the commission, received by reason of continued operation that are in excess of the rates, fares, or charges finally determined to be just and reasonable by the commission.  Interest on any excess shall commence as of the date that any rate, fare, or charge goes into effect that results in the excess and shall continue to accrue on the balance of the excess until returned.
     (g)  In any case of two or more organizations, trades, or businesses (whether or not incorporated, whether or not organized in the State, and whether or not affiliated) owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests, the commission may distribute, apportion, or allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances between or among the organizations, trades, or businesses, if it determines that the distribution, apportionment, or allocation is necessary to adequately reflect the income of any such organizations, trades, or businesses to carry out the regulatory duties imposed by this section.
     (h)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, for telecommunications carrier having annual gross revenues of less than $2,000,000, the commission may make and amend its rules and procedures to provide the commission with sufficient facts necessary to determine the reasonableness of the proposed rates without unduly burdening the telecommunications carrier company and its customers.
     §   -39  Cross-subsidies.  (a)  The commission shall ensure that noncompetitive services shall not cross-subsidize competitive services.  Cross-subsidization shall be deemed to have occurred:
     (1)  If any competitive service is priced below the total service long-run incremental cost of providing the service as determined by the commission in subsection (b); or
     (2)  If competitive services, taken as a whole, fail to cover their direct and allocated joint and common costs as determined by the commission.
     (b)  The commission shall determine the methodology and frequency with which telecommunications carriers calculate total service long-run incremental cost and fully allocated joint and common costs.  The total service long-run incremental cost of a service shall include an imputation of an amount equal to the contribution that the telecommunications carrier receives from noncompetitive inputs used by alternative providers in providing the same or equivalent service.
     §   -40  Separate affiliate audits.  The commission shall receive the results of joint federal and state audits required for companies required to operate separate affiliates and obtain and pay for a joint federal and state audit every two years from an independent auditor pursuant to 47 U.S.C. section 272(d), as amended.  The commission shall make the results of the audit available for public inspection.
     §   -41  Unfair or deceptive acts or practices.  The commission shall adopt rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices by telecommunications carriers and telecommunications service providers including resellers and aggregators of telecommunications services.  Unfair or deceptive acts or practices may include unauthorized changes in subscriber carrier selections.
     §   -42  Lifeline telephone rates.  (a)  The commission shall implement a program to achieve lifeline telephone rates for residential telephone users.  The commission may achieve lifeline telephone rates by using funds collected pursuant to section    -23 and deposited in the commission special fund pursuant to section    -22.  In conjunction with these funds, or alternatively, the commission may seek appropriations of funds from the legislature.
     (b)  For purposes of this section, "lifeline telephone rate" means a discounted rate for residential telephone users identified as elders with limited income and the handicapped with limited income as designated by the commission by rule.
     (c)  The commission shall require every telecommunications carrier providing local telephone service to file a schedule of rates and charges providing a rate for lifeline telephone subscribers.
     (d)  Nothing in this section shall preclude the commission from changing any rate established pursuant to subsection (a) either specifically or pursuant to any general restructuring of all telephone rates, charges, and classifications.
     §   -43  Carriers of last resort.  (a)  The commission may define and designate local exchange service areas where the commission has determined that a single provider will be the most appropriate way to ensure service for these areas.
     (b)  The commission shall determine the level of service that is appropriate for each designated local exchange service area and shall invite telecommunications providers to bid for a level of service that is appropriate.  The successful bidder shall be designated the carrier of last resort for the designated local exchange service area for a period of time and upon conditions set by the commission.  In determining the successful bidder, the commission shall take into consideration the level of service to be provided, the investment commitment, and the length of the agreement, in addition to the other qualifications of the bidder.
     (c)  The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to carry out the provisions of this section.
     §   -44  Telecommunications relay services for the deaf, persons with hearing disabilities, and persons with speech disabilities.  (a)  The commission shall implement intrastate telecommunications relay services for the deaf, persons with hearing disabilities, and persons with speech disabilities.
     (b)  The commission shall investigate the availability of experienced providers of quality telecommunications relay services for the deaf, persons with hearing disabilities, and persons with speech disabilities.  The provision of these telecommunications relay services shall be awarded by the commission to the provider or providers the commission determines to be best qualified to provide these services.  In reviewing the qualifications of the provider or providers, the commission shall consider the factors of cost, quality of services, and experience, and any other factors as the commission deems appropriate.
     (c)  If the commission determines that the telecommunications relay service can be provided in a cost-effective manner by a service provider or service providers, the commission may require every intrastate telecommunications carrier to contract with the provider or providers for the provision of the telecommunications relay service under the terms established by the commission.
     (d)  The commission may establish a surcharge to collect customer contributions for telecommunications relay services required under this section.
     (e)  The commission may adopt rules to establish a mechanism to recover the costs of administering and providing telecommunications relay services required under this section.
     (f)  The commission shall require every intrastate telecommunications carrier to file a schedule of rates and charges and every provider of telecommunications relay service to maintain a separate accounting for the costs of providing telecommunications relay services for the deaf, persons with hearing disabilities, and persons with speech disabilities.
     (g)  Nothing in this section shall preclude the commission from changing any rate established pursuant to this section either specifically or pursuant to any general restructuring of all telephone rates, charges, and classifications.
     (h)  As used in this section:
     "Telecommunications relay services" means telephone transmission services that provide an individual who has a hearing or speech disability the ability to engage in communication by wire or radio with a hearing individual in a manner that is functionally equivalent to the ability of an individual who does not have a hearing or speech disability to communicate using wire or radio voice communication services.
     "Telecommunications relay services" includes services that enable two-way communication using text telephones or other non-voice terminal devices, speech-to-speech services, video relay services, and non-English relay services.
     §   -45  Telecommunications number portability.  The commission shall ensure that telecommunications number portability within an exchange is available, upon request, as soon as technically feasible and economically reasonable.  An impartial entity shall administer telecommunications numbering and make the numbers available on an equitable basis.
     §   -46  Emergency telephone service; capital costs; ratemaking.  (a)  A telecommunications carrier providing local exchange telecommunications services may recover the capital cost and associated operating expenses of providing a statewide enhanced 911 emergency telephone service in the public switched telephone network, through a telephone line surcharge.
     (b)  The commission shall require every telecommunications carrier providing statewide enhanced 911 emergency telephone service to maintain a separate accounting of the costs of providing an enhanced 911 emergency service and the revenues received from related surcharges.  The commission shall further require that every telecommunications carrier imposing a surcharge shall identify such as a separate line item on all customer billing statements.
     (c)  This section shall not preclude the commission from changing any rate, established pursuant to this section, either specifically or pursuant to any general restructuring of all telephone rates, charges, and classifications.
     §   -47  Issuance of securities.  A telecommunications carrier corporation may, on securing the prior approval of the commission, and not otherwise, issue stocks and stock certificates, bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness, payable at periods of more than twelve months after the date thereof, for the following purposes and no other, namely:  for the acquisition of property or for the construction, completion, extension, or improvement of or addition to its facilities or service, or for the discharge or lawful refunding of its obligations or for the reimbursement of moneys actually expended from income or from any other moneys in its treasury not secured by or obtained from the issue of its stocks or stock certificates, or bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness, for any of the aforesaid purposes except maintenance of service, replacements, and substitutions not constituting capital expenditure in cases where the corporation has kept its accounts for the expenditures in a manner as to enable the commission to ascertain the amount of moneys so expended and the purposes for which the expenditures were made, and the sources of the funds in its treasury applied to the expenditures.  As used herein, "property" and "facilities" mean property and facilities used in all operations of a telecommunications carrier corporation whether or not included in its operations or rate base.  A telecommunications carrier corporation may not issue securities to acquire property or to construct, complete, extend, improve, or add to its facilities or service if the commission determines that the proposed purpose will have a material adverse effect on its telecommunications carrier operations.
     All stock and every stock certificate, and every bond, note, or other evidence of indebtedness of a telecommunications carrier corporation not payable within twelve months, issued without an order of the commission authorizing the same, then in effect, shall be void.
     §   -48  Issuance of voting stock; restrictions.  (a)  For purposes of this section:
     "Foreign corporation" means a foreign corporation as defined in section 235-1 or a corporation in which a majority of the voting stock is held by a single foreign corporation as defined in section 235-1.
     "Nonresident alien" means a person not a citizen of the United States who is not defined as a resident alien by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.
     (b)  No more than twenty-five per cent of the issued and outstanding voting stock of a corporation organized under the laws of this State and that owns, controls, operates, or manages any plant or equipment, or any part thereof, as a telecommunications carrier within the definition set forth in section    -1 shall be held, whether directly or indirectly, by any single foreign corporation or any single nonresident alien, or held by any person, unless prior written approval is obtained from the commission, or unless a transaction is exempt.  An exempt transaction is:
     (1)  Any purchase or sale by an underwriter; or
     (2)  A transaction to acquire shares of a corporation with less than one hundred shareholders and less than $1,000,000 in assets.
     Every assignment, transfer, contract, or agreement for assignment or transfer of any shares in violation of this section shall be void and of no effect; and no such transfer shall be made on the books of the corporation.  Nothing herein shall be construed to make illegal the holding of stock lawfully held, directly or indirectly, prior to June 4, 1977.
     §   -49  Acquirement of stock of another telecommunications carrier.  No person or entity shall purchase or acquire, take or hold, any part of the capital stock of any telecommunications carrier corporation, organized or existing under or by virtue of the laws of this State, without having been first authorized to do so by the order of the commission.  Every assignment, transfer, contract, or agreement for assignment or transfer of any stock by or through any person or corporation to any corporation or otherwise in violation of this section shall be void and of no effect; and no such transfer shall be made on the books of any telecommunications carrier.  Nothing herein shall be construed to make illegal the holding of stock lawfully acquired before July 1, 1933.

     §   -51  Injury to carrier property.  Any person who injures or destroys, through want of proper care, any necessary or useful facility, equipment or property of any telecommunications carrier shall be liable to the telecommunications carrier for all damages sustained thereby.  The measure of damages to the facility, equipment, or property injured or destroyed shall be the cost to repair or replace the facility, equipment, or property injured or destroyed including direct and allocated costs for labor, materials, supervision, supplies, tools, taxes, transportation, and administrative and general expense and other indirect or overhead expenses, less credit, if any, for salvage.  Specifying the measure of damages for the facility, equipment, or property shall not preclude the recovery of any other damages occasioned thereby as may be authorized by law.
     §   -52  One call center; advance warning to excavators.  To finance the establishment and operation of the one call center, pursuant to chapter 269E, and the administrative costs of the commission, the commission shall direct telecommunications carriers to pay to the public utilities commission a fee in an amount and at a schedule determined by the public utilities commission.

     (1)  Posting and display of information in a prominent and conspicuous fashion on or near the telephone equipment owned or controlled by the aggregator which states the identity of the operator service provider, the operator service provider's complaint handling procedures, and means by which the customer may access the various operator service providers.
     (2)  Identification by name of the operator service provider prior to the call connection and, if not posted pursuant to subsection (b)(1), a disclosure of pertinent rates, terms, conditions, and means of access to various operator service providers and the local exchange carriers; provided that the operator service provider shall disclose this information at any time upon request by the customer.
     (3)  Allowing the customer access to any operator service provider operating in the relevant geographic area through the access method chosen by the provider or as deemed appropriate by the commission.
     (4)  Other requirements as deemed reasonable by the commission in the areas of public safety, quality of service, unjust or discriminatory pricing, or other matters in the public interest."]
     SECTION 36.  Section 269-16.9, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed.
     ["§269-16.9  Telecommunications providers and services.  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the commission, upon its own motion or upon the application of any person, and upon notice and hearing, may exempt a telecommunications provider or a telecommunications service from any or all of the provisions of this chapter, except the provisions of section 269-34, upon a determination that the exemption is in the public interest.  In determining whether an exemption is in the public interest, the commission shall consider whether the exemption promotes state policies in telecommunications, the development, maintenance, and operation of effective and economically efficient telecommunications services, and the furnishing of telecommunications services at just and reasonable rates and in a fair manner in view of the needs of the various customer segments of the telecommunications industry.  Among the specific factors the commission may consider are:
     (1)  The responsiveness of the exemption to changes in the structure and technology of the State's telecommunications industry;
     (2)  The benefits accruing to the customers and users of the exempt telecommunications provider or service;
     (3)  The impact of the exemption on the quality, efficiency, and availability of telecommunications services;
     (4)  The impact of the exemption on the maintenance of fair, just, and reasonable rates for telecommunications services;
     (5)  The likelihood of prejudice or disadvantage to ratepayers of basic local exchange service resulting from the exemption;
     (6)  The effect of the exemption on the preservation and promotion of affordable, universal, basic telecommunications services as those services are determined by the commission;
     (7)  The resulting subsidization, if any, of the exempt telecommunications service or provider by nonexempt services;
     (8)  The impact of the exemption on the availability of diversity in the supply of telecommunications services throughout the State;
     (9)  The improvements in the regulatory system to be gained from the exemption, including the reduction in regulatory delays and costs;
    (10)  The impact of the exemption on promoting innovations in telecommunications services;
    (11)  The opportunity provided by the exemption for telecommunications providers to respond to competition; and
    (12)  The potential for the exercise of substantial market power by the exempt provider or by a provider of the exempt telecommunications service.
     (b)  The commission shall expedite, where practicable, the regulatory process with respect to exemptions and shall adopt guidelines under which each provider of an exempted service shall be subject to similar terms and conditions.
     (c)  The commission may condition or limit any exemption as the commission deems necessary in the public interest.  The commission may provide a trial period for any exemption and may terminate the exemption or continue it for such period and under such conditions and limitations as it deems appropriate.
     (d)  The commission may require a telecommunications provider to apply for a certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to section 269-7.5; provided that the commission may waive any application requirement whenever it deems the waiver to be in furtherance of the purposes of this section.  The exemptions under this section may be granted in a proceeding for certification or in a separate proceeding.
     (e)  The commission may waive other regulatory requirements under this chapter applicable to telecommunications providers when it determines that competition will serve the same purpose as public interest regulation.
     (f)  If any provider of an exempt telecommunications service or any exempt telecommunications provider elects to terminate its service, it shall provide notice of this to its customers, the commission, and every telephone public utility providing basic local exchange service in this State.  The notice shall be in writing and given not less than six months before the intended termination date.  Upon termination of service by a provider of an exempt service or by an exempt provider, the appropriate telephone public utility providing basic local exchange service shall ensure that all customers affected by the termination receive basic local exchange service.  The commission shall, upon notice and hearing or by rule, determine the party or parties who shall bear the cost, if any, of access to the basic local exchange service by the customers of the terminated exempt service.
     (g)  Upon the petition of any person or upon its own motion, the commission may rescind any exemption or waiver granted under this section if, after notice and hearing, it finds that the conditions prompting the granting of the exemption or waiver no longer apply, or that the exemption or waiver is no longer in the public interest, or that the telecommunications provider has failed to comply with one or more of the conditions of the exemption or applicable statutory or regulatory requirements.
     (h)  For purposes of this section, the commission, upon determination that any area of the State has less than adequate telecommunications service, shall require the existing telecommunications provider to show cause as to why the commission should not authorize an alternative telecommunications provider for that area under the terms and conditions of this section."]
     SECTION 37.  Section 269-16.91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed.
     ["[§269-16.91]  Universal service subsidies.  (a)  For any alternative telecommunications provider authorized to provide basic local exchange service to any area of the State pursuant to section 269-16.9(h), the commission may consider the following:
     (1)  Transferring the subsidy, if any, of the local exchange provider's basic residential telephone service to the alternative provider; and
     (2)  Transferring from the local exchange carrier to the alternative provider the amounts, if any, generated by the local exchange provider's services other than basic residential telephone service and which are used to subsidize basic residential service in the area.
     (b)  To receive the subsidy amounts from the local exchange service provider, the alternative telecommunications provider shall be required, to the extent possible, to obtain basic residential service subsidies from both the local exchange service provider and national universal service providers."]
     SECTION 38.  Section 269-16.92, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed.
     ["[§269-16.92]  Changes in subscriber carrier selections; prior authorization required; penalties for unauthorized changes.  (a)  No telecommunications carrier shall initiate a change in a subscriber's selection or designation of a long-distance carrier without first receiving:
     (1)  A letter of agency or letter of authorization;
     (2)  An electronic authorization by use of a toll-free number;
     (3)  An oral authorization verified by an independent third party; or
     (4)  Any other prescribed authorization;
provided that the letter or authorization shall be in accordance with verification procedures that are prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission or the public utilities commission.  For purposes of this section, "telecommunications carrier" does not include a provider of commercial mobile radio service as defined by 47 United States Code section 332(d)(1).
     (b)  Upon a determination that any telecommunications carrier has engaged in conduct that is prohibited in subsection (a), the public utilities commission shall order the carrier to take corrective action as deemed necessary by the commission and may subject the telecommunications carrier to administrative penalties pursuant to section 269-28.  Any proceeds from administrative penalties collected under this section shall be deposited into the public utilities commission special fund.
     The commission, if consistent with the public interest, may suspend, restrict, or revoke the registration, charter, or certificate of the telecommunications carrier, thereby denying, modifying, or limiting the right of the telecommunications carrier to provide service in this State.
     (c)  The commission shall adopt rules, pursuant to chapter 91, necessary for the purposes of this section.  The commission may notify customers of their rights under these rules."]
     SECTION 39.  Section 269-16.95, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed.
     ["§269-16.95  Emergency telephone service; capital costs; ratemaking.  (a)  A public utility providing local exchange telecommunications services may recover the capital cost and associated operating expenses of providing a statewide enhanced 911 emergency telephone service in the public switched telephone network, through:
     (1)  A telephone line surcharge; or
     (2)  Its rate case.
     (b)  Notwithstanding the commission's rules on ratemaking, the commission shall expedite and give highest priority to any necessary ratemaking procedures related to providing a statewide enhanced 911 emergency telephone service; provided that the commission may set forth conditions and requirements as the commission determines are in the public interest.
     (c)  The commission shall require every public utility providing statewide enhanced 911 emergency telephone service to maintain a separate accounting of the costs of providing an enhanced 911 emergency service and the revenues received from related surcharges until the next general rate case.  The commission shall further require that every public utility imposing a surcharge shall identify such as a separate line item on all customer billing statements.
     (d)  This section shall not preclude the commission from changing any rate, established pursuant to this section, either specifically or pursuant to any general restructuring of all telephone rates, charges, and classifications."]
     SECTION 40.  Section 269-34, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed.
     ["[§269-34]  Obligations of telecommunications carriers.  In accordance with conditions and guidelines established by the commission to facilitate the introduction of competition into the State's telecommunications marketplace, each telecommunications carrier, upon bona fide request, shall provide services or information services, on reasonable terms and conditions, to an entity seeking to provide intrastate telecommunications, including:
     (1)  Interconnection to the telecommunications carrier's telecommunications facilities at any technically feasible and economically reasonable point within the telecommunications carrier's network so that the networks are fully interoperable;
     (2)  The current interstate tariff used as the access rate until the commission can adopt a new intrastate local service interconnection tariff pursuant to section 269-37;
     (3)  Nondiscriminatory and equal access to any telecommunications carrier's telecommunications facilities, functions, and the information necessary to the transmission and routing of any telecommunications service and the interoperability of both carriers' networks;
     (4)  Nondiscriminatory access among all telecommunications carriers, where technically feasible and economically reasonable, and where safety or the provision of existing electrical service is not at risk, to the poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way owned or controlled by the telecommunications carrier, or the commission shall authorize access to electric utilities' poles as provided by the joint pole agreement, commission tariffs, rules, orders, or Federal Communications Commission rules and regulations;
     (5)  Nondiscriminatory access to the network functions of the telecommunications carrier's telecommunications network, that shall be offered on an unbundled, competitively neutral, and cost-based basis;
     (6)  Telecommunications services and network functions without unreasonable restrictions on the resale or sharing of those services and functions; and
     (7)  Nondiscriminatory access of customers to the telecommunications carrier of their choice without the need to dial additional digits or access codes, where technically feasible.  The commission shall determine the equitable distribution of costs among the authorized telecommunications carriers that will use such access and shall establish rules to ensure such access.
     Where possible, telecommunications carriers shall enter into negotiations to agree on the provision of services or information services without requiring intervention by the commission; provided that any such agreement shall be subject to review by the commission to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section."]

     ["[§269-37]  Compensation agreements.  The commission shall ensure that telecommunications carriers are compensated on a fair basis for termination of telecommunications services on each other's networks, taking into account, among other things, reasonable and necessary costs to each telecommunications carrier of providing the services in question.  Telecommunications carriers may negotiate compensation arrangements, that may include "bill and keep", mutual and equal compensation, or any other reasonable division of revenues pending tariff access rates to be set by the commission.  Upon failure of the negotiations, the commission shall determine the proper methodology and amount of compensation."]
     SECTION 44.  Section 269-38, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed.
     ["[§269-38]  Regulatory flexibility for effectively competitive services.  The commission may allow telecommunications carriers to have pricing flexibility for services that the commission finds are effectively competitive; provided that the rates for:
     (1)  Basic telephone service and for services that are not effectively competitive are cost-based and remain just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory; and

     (1)  If any competitive service is priced below the total service long-run incremental cost of providing the service as determined by the commission in subsection (b); or
     (2)  If competitive services, taken as a whole, fail to cover their direct and allocated joint and common costs as determined by the commission.
     (b)  The commission shall determine the methodology and frequency with which providers calculate total service long-run incremental cost and fully allocated joint and common costs.  The total service long-run incremental cost of a service shall include an imputation of an amount equal to the contribution that the telecommunications carrier receives from noncompetitive inputs used by alternative providers in providing the same or equivalent service."]

     ["[§269-40]  Access to advanced services.  The commission shall ensure that all consumers are provided with nondiscriminatory, reasonable, and equitable access to high quality telecommunications network facilities and capabilities that provide subscribers with sufficient network capacity to access information services that provide a combination of voice, data, image, and video, and that are available at just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory rates that are based on reasonably identifiable costs of providing the services."]
     SECTION 47.  Section 269-41, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed.
     ["[§269-41]  Universal service program; establishment; purpose; principles.  There is established the universal service program.  The purpose of this program is to:

     (e)  The commission shall require all telecommunications carriers to contribute to the universal service program.  The commission may require a person other than a telecommunications carrier to contribute to the universal service program if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the commission determines that the person is offering a commercial service in the State that directly benefits from the telecommunications infrastructure, and that directly competes with a telecommunications service provided in the State for which a contribution is required under this subsection.
     (f)  The commission shall designate the method by which the contributions under subsection (e) shall be calculated and collected.  The commission shall consider basing contributions solely on the gross operating revenues from the retail provision of intrastate telecommunications services offered by the telecommunications carriers subject to the contribution."]
     SECTION 49.  Section 269-43, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed.
     ["[§269-43]  Carriers of last resort.  (a)  The commission may define and designate local exchange service areas where the commission has determined that providing universal service funds to a single provider will be the most appropriate way to ensure service for these areas.
     (b)  The commission shall determine the level of service that is appropriate for each designated local exchange service area and shall invite telecommunications providers to bid for a level of service that is appropriate.  The successful bidder shall be designated the carrier of last resort for the designated local exchange service area for a period of time and upon conditions set by the commission.  In determining the successful bidder, the commission shall take into consideration the level of service to be provided, the investment commitment, and the length of the agreement, in addition to the other qualifications of the bidder.
     (c)  The universal service fund shall also provide service drops and basic service at discounted rates to public institutions, as stated in section 269-41.
     (d)  The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to carry out the provisions of this section."]
