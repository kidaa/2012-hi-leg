HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES TO ENACT THE VISA IMPROVEMENTS TO STIMULATE INTERNATIONAL TOURISM TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ACT.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, building relationships with nations like China, India, and other emerging economies and powers is vital for the United States; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii is well positioned to be a place where East meets West to build commercial, diplomatic, and strategic ties for mutual benefit; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Pacific region is a vast market for new visitors and reforming our visa process is a cost-effective, common-sense way to make it easier and more inviting for international businesses and visitors to come to Hawaii and the rest of the United States; and
 
     WHEREAS, the recently introduced bipartisan legislation, the Visa Improvements to Stimulate International Tourism to the United States of America Act, H.R. 3341, 2011 (VISIT USA Act), by cutting red tape and reforming United States visa policies, could potentially bring an estimated increase of 280,000 visitors yearly from China, Canada, and other high-growth markets to Hawaii, boosting economic growth in the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, the VISIT USA Act would establish five-year multiple entry visas for Chinese visitors, extend the time Canadian retirees can stay in the United States, make changes to the Visa Waiver Program, and make other low-cost reforms that would increase tourism to Hawaii and the rest of the United States; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2010 more than 54,000,000 Chinese citizens travelled abroad and Europe welcomed 3,700,000 of these visitors, but the United States received only 800,000 Chinese visitors, of which a mere 62,000 came to Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, improvements to the visa process and other policy changes will provide a huge economic boost to Hawaii by, among other things, facilitating more visitors from other countries such as China in travelling to the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is estimated that the average visitor from China would stay in the State for six days and spend $350 a day, yielding an estimated $573,000,000 for Hawaii's economy; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2008 the Homeland Security Secretary signed a visa waiver program memorandum of understanding with South Korea that has helped Hawaii recognize steady growth in visitors from South Korea each year; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Congress of the United States is urged to enact the VISIT USA Act; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Majority Leader, United States Senate; the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives; the members of Hawaii's congressional delegation; the Governor; and the National Conference of State Legislatures.
