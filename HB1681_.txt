     "§377-     Hours of labor for domestic workers.  (a)  No person or corporation employing a domestic worker, as defined in section 377-1, shall require the domestic worker to work more than the following number of hours per week unless the domestic worker receives compensation for overtime work at a rate that is equal to at least one and one-half times the worker's normal wage rate:
