HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF ACCOUNTING AND GENERAL SERVICES, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, TO DETERMINE THE COST OF PLACING AN OVERPASS OVER THE H-1 FREEWAY TO EXTEND BETWEEN NUUANU STREAM AND QUEEN EMMA STREET THAT WOULD REDUCE TRAFFIC NOISE POLLUTION AND BE USED AS A PARK OR OTHER COMMUNITY USE PURPOSE.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the H-1 freeway is the most utilized freeway in the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, twenty-four hours a day, many residents who live near the H-1 freeway are subjected to excessive traffic noise pollution emanating from passing cars; and
 
     WHEREAS, traffic noise pollution can affect a person's ability to work, learn, rest, relax, and sleep, as well as lead to mental and physical health problems; and
 
     WHEREAS, there is a shortage of parks and recreation in the downtown area; and
 
     WHEREAS, constructing an overpass with sufficient structural capacity to support open green space such as a park would greatly improve the standard of living for residents of the State by providing the dual benefit of reducing traffic noise pollution from the H-1 freeway and adding an additional park to the downtown area; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Accounting and General Services is requested to consult with the Department of Transportation to determine the cost of placing an overpass over the H-1 freeway to extend between Nuuanu Stream and Queen Emma Street that would reduce traffic noise pollution and be used as a community park or other community use purpose; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Accounting and General Services is requested to submit a report on its findings and recommendations to the Legislature not later than twenty days prior to the convening of the 2013 Regular Session; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Comptroller and the Director of Transportation.
