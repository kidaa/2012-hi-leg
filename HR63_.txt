HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PLAN TO CREATE A STATE CAPITOL MEMORIAL TO HONOR THE VETERANS OF THE PERSIAN GULF WAR, OPERATION DESERT STORM, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM, OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, AND OPERATION NEW DAWN.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the freedom, liberties, and security that make the United States unique and that citizens of the United States enjoy are direct results of the sacrifices and continued vigilance of the United States armed forces over the course of our nation's history; and
 
     WHEREAS, in furtherance of this noble and important purpose, members of the United States armed forces have engaged in combat in several areas of the world over the past several years, including:
 
     (1)  In Kuwait, by leading a coalition of international forces codenamed Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf War that liberated Kuwait from Iraq;
    
     (2)  In Iraq, by leading a coalition of international forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom to defeat the brutal authoritarian regime of Saddam Hussein and subsequently in Operation New Dawn to enable the building of a stable democracy in Iraq by its people by, among other things, training Iraqi security forces and mounting counterterrorism operations; and
 
     (3)  In Afghanistan, by waging the ongoing war on terrorism in Operation Enduring Freedom in response to the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, to confront terrorists on their own ground;
 
and
     WHEREAS, as President Barack Obama has recognized, the members of the United States armed forces, who are "the steel in our ship of state," have completed every mission they were given at enormous sacrifice, with thousands giving their lives and tens of thousands being wounded; and
 
     WHEREAS, on July 24, 1994, Hawaii dedicated the Korean and Vietnam War Memorial on the grounds of the State Capitol; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is fitting and necessary for the State to also tangibly and visibly honor the veterans who served in the Persian Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation New Dawn, and recognize their sacrifices and contributions; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the State of Hawaii Office of Veterans' Services, with the assistance of the Department of Accounting and General Services and the Department of Defense, is requested to develop a plan to create a memorial on the grounds of the State Capitol, near the Korean and Vietnam War Memorial, that would honor the veterans of the Persian Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation New Dawn; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that in conjunction with the foregoing plan development the Office of Veterans' Services is requested to hold a public hearing to receive comments or input from interested organizations, Hawaii residents, and the general public; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Office of Veterans' Services, with the assistance of the Department of Accounting and General Services and Department of Defense, is further directed to submit a report of its findings and recommendations, including proposed legislation, if any, to the Legislature no later than January 1, 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Adjutant General; Director of the Office of Veterans' Services; and the Comptroller.
