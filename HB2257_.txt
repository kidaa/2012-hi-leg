     (1)  Who is certified or licensed to perform services in a state other than Hawaii;
     (2)  Whose spouse is a member of the armed forces of the United States;
     (3)  Whose spouse is the subject of a military transfer to Hawaii; and
     (4)  Who left employment to accompany the person's spouse to Hawaii.
     (b)  The procedure shall include:
     (1)  Issuing the person a license, certificate, or permit if in the opinion of the licensing authority, the requirements for licensure or certification of the other state are equal to, or greater than, the requirements of this State; or
     (2)  Developing a method to authorize the person to perform services regulated by the licensing authority in this State by issuing to the person a temporary permit for a limited period of time to allow the person to perform specified services while completing any requirements necessary for licensing or certification in this State that were not required in the state in which the person was licensed or certified."
