TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE BUREAU TO CONDUCT A STUDY ON REQUIRING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, autism is a complex developmental disability that is considered a spectrum disorder by health care professionals as individuals with autism spectrum disorders may share common symptoms with others similarly diagnosed, but the severity of their conditions can vary widely across the spectrum; and
 
     WHEREAS, autism spectrum disorders currently include autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, which is also known as atypical autism; and
 
     WHEREAS, those affected by an autism spectrum disorder usually show such symptoms as delays or difficulties with social interaction and interpersonal skills and verbal and non-verbal communication, and repetitive or obsessive behavior; and
 
     WHEREAS, symptoms of an autism spectrum disorder generally begin before the age of three and can persist through adulthood; and
 
     WHEREAS, health care professionals advise that early and intensive treatment efforts, especially applied behavior analysis, may greatly assist with developmental disabilities related to autism spectrum disorders and prevent an affected individual from becoming permanently dependent on family members or a lifelong ward of the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, autism spectrum disorders are becoming increasingly prevalent in Hawaii, and treatment for these disorders places a huge financial burden on Hawaii families as treatment is not presently covered by Hawaii health insurers; and      WHEREAS, extending insurance coverage to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders would provide much needed assistance to affected Hawaii families, and improve the potential for those with an autism spectrum disorder to live a more productive life; and
 
     WHEREAS, the potential benefits to individuals with an autism spectrum disorder and their families would equally benefit the State by creating long-term savings as a result of positive treatment outcomes that would seem to outweigh the short-term costs; and
 
     WHEREAS, Senate Bill No. 2631, S.D.2, introduced in the Regular Session of 2012, proposes to require insurance coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders by accident and health or sickness insurers, mutual benefit societies, and health maintenance organizations; and
 
     WHEREAS, twenty-nine states currently require that health insurers provide coverage for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders, and there is now cost data available to study the effect on insurance premiums of providing such treatment; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2010, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted, which requires that health insurance exchanges offer insurance coverage for essential health benefits, including behavioral health treatment; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2009, the Auditor submitted a report to the Governor and the Legislature entitled Study of the Social and Financial Impacts of Mandatory Health Insurance Coverage for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorders, an issue which the Senate Committee on Ways and Means recently requested the Auditor to revisit in consideration of the services proposed by Senate Bill No. 2631, S.D.2, Regular Session of 2012, and the changes to insurance coverage required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; now, therefore,      BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Legislative Reference Bureau is requested to:
 
     (1)  Assess the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on the proposal in Senate Bill No. 2631, S.D. 2, Regular Session of 2012, to require insurance coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders by accident and health or sickness insurers, mutual benefit societies, and health maintenance organizations; and
 
     (2)  Analyze the cost of providing insurance coverage for autism spectrum disorders in Hawaii, based on actual cost effects experienced in other states that require such coverage; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislative Reference Bureau is requested to report its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Acting Director of the Legislative Reference Bureau, the Insurance Commissioner, and the Director of Health.
