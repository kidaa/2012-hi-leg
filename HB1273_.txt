A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO APPROPRIATIONS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The University of Hawaii college of tropical agriculture and human resources cooperative extension service is a part of the world's largest non-traditional education system, the cooperative extension system, which can be found in almost all of the world's countries and in the fifty United States.  The cooperative extension system is a partnership between federal, state, and local governments and is responsible for providing science-based information and educational programs in agriculture, natural resources, and human resources.  Due to the present lack of federal funding, Hawaii's cooperative extension system is facing many challenges.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to the University of Hawaii college of tropical agriculture and human resources cooperative extension service to support the growth and sustainability of the local agriculture industry.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $500,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the support of the University of Hawaii college of tropical agriculture and human resources cooperative extension service, including the ability to hire necessary staff.
SECTION 3.  The sum appropriated shall be expended by the University of Hawaii for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
