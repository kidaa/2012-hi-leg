TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
MAKING AN APPROPRIATION FOR THE HOMELESS PROGRAMS OFFICE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that homelessness is the resulting condition of Hawaii's most vulnerable.  The legislature further finds that according to a 2010 report, some 13,886 adults and children in Hawaii experienced homelessness.  This represents a three per cent increase from a year ago.
     The state homeless programs office provides services critical to the homeless safety net, including developing programs and transitional facilities, providing shelter and social services, providing policy direction for homeless programs, including implementation of the statewide continuum of care, and integrating federal grant resources with state resources to provide that continuum of care.
     A lack of resources has severely limited the ability of the homeless programs office to meet the needs of the growing homeless population.  Last fiscal year, it lost half of its positions due to a reduction-in-force and its operating budget was reduced by millions of dollars, despite the temporary benefit of federal stimulus funds.
     The purpose of this Act is to restore funding to the homeless programs office of the department of human services.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 to increase funding and positions for the homeless programs office of the department of human services.
     The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of human services for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
