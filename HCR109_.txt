RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING CONGRESS TO CREATE A SEPARATE BRANCH OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES TO COMBAT CYBER CRIMES, CYBER WARFARE, AND CYBER TERRORISM.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the nation's reliance on the World Wide Web has far exceeded our ability to detect, deter, and destroy threats, leaving us vulnerable to cyber attacks and cyber terrorism;
 
WHEREAS, these types of cyber crimes can compromise the security of the United States of America; and 
 
     WHEREAS, the United States of America experiences thousands of computer hacking attempts over the course of one day, it is evident that a successful breach of security is inevitable; and
 
     WHEREAS, other countries are taking measures to prepare for cyber war, among them are; Russia, Israel, North Korea, Iran, and China; and
 
WHEREAS, China already has a cyber force in place, and a budget of considerable funds; and
 
     WHEREAS, Leon Panetta, the United States Secretary of Defense, recently warned that "cyber warfare is very real" and could "paralyze this country"; and
 
     WHEREAS, the White House's Office of the Press Secretary recently stated that "the cyber security vulnerabilities in our government and critical infrastructure are a risk to national security, public safety, and economic prosperity"; and
 
     WHEREAS, to ensure the defense of the nation's vital infrastructure, cyberspace must be viewed as the fifth domain of warfare, after land, sea, air, and space, with its own branch of the United States Armed Forces devoted to defending America from cyber attacks; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that Congress is encouraged to create a separate branch of the United States Armed Forces to combat cyber crimes, cyber warfare, and cyber terrorism; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States, the Secretary of the United States Department of Defense, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the President Pro-Tempore of the United States Senate, and the Hawaii congressional delegation, the Governor of the State of Hawaii and the Adjutant General of the State Department of Defense.
