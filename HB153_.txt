     (1)  Federal Safe Routes to School program funds; and
     (2)  Fines collected for speeding in a school zone, pursuant to section 291C-104, Hawaii Revised Statutes.
Moneys in the fund shall be distributed by the director of transportation to the respective counties to expend.  The director of transportation shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to implement this Act.  The rules shall establish a formula by which the moneys in the fund shall be distributed to each county and provide how the county shall expend the moneys for traffic calming measures in public school zones.
     [(a)] (b)  The director of transportation, through the Safe Routes to School coordinator, and in consultation with the department of education, department of health, and Hawaii Association of Independent Schools, shall provide [federal] Safe Routes to School [program] funds for school-based and community-based workshops and infrastructure and non-infrastructure projects that will reduce vehicular traffic and congestion, encourage walking and bicycling, and promote health and safety around Hawaii's schools.  Implementation of the Safe Routes to School program shall take into consideration the need to:
     (1)  Create and fill a permanent, full-time position of Safe Routes to School coordinator within the department of transportation to provide a central point of contact for the program;
     (2)  Maximize the participation of stakeholder groups in the community and school officials;
     (3)  Train volunteer facilitators for school-based workshops and community-based projects, including flexible training schedules;
     (4)  Train potential grant requestors and stakeholder groups in federal and state requirements necessary in procurement, contracts, design, and construction; and
     (5)  Allocate not less than ten per cent and not more than thirty per cent of the apportionment of [federal] Safe Routes to School [program] funds for non-infrastructure-related activities or activities to encourage walking and bicycling to school, public awareness campaigns, student sessions on bicycle and pedestrian safety, or other non-infrastructure activities as prescribed under Section 1404 of P.L. 109-59 of the federal Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act.
     [(b)] (c)  Each grant proposal in the Safe Routes to School program shall:
     (1)  Identify the modes of travel used by students to get to school;
     (2)  Determine the number of students using each mode of travel;
     (3)  Survey the parents of each student to gather information regarding the factors involved in the choice of transportation mode for the student and, where the student travels by automobile or bus, what would need to change for the parent to permit the student to walk or ride a bicycle to school, and obstacles to walking and biking; and
(4)    Identify traffic infrastructure elements in the immediate vicinity of each school, including multi-lane roadways, speed limits, and traffic calming features that, either by their presence or absence, contribute to the use of automobiles as a student's mode of travel to school."
     SECTION 2.  Section 291C-104, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:
     "(c)  Any person who violates this section shall be fined [$250] $350, of which $100 is to be deposited in the safe routes to school fund, and may be charged with a surcharge of up to $100 to be deposited into the trauma system special fund."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
