TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 

HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
ENCOURAGING GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO PLANT FOOD BEARING TREES ON LANDS OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE STATE OR A COUNTY.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the State is over-reliant on outside sources for food, importing eighty-five percent of the food in Hawaii at a cost of approximately $3,000,000,000 each year; and
 
     WHEREAS, food self-sufficiency is one of the foundations of a sustainable community; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is in the public interest to pursue the common good whereby all families and individuals in Hawaii have improved access to food, which helps families achieve self-sufficiency and financial security while reducing the number of Hawaii residents living in poverty; and
 
     WHEREAS, a disaster thousands of miles away can adversely affect Hawaii days later, thus making it essential for the State to find ways to increase the amount of locally grown food available for public consumption; and
 
     WHEREAS, a growing population often results in housing and agriculture competing for the same land resources; and
 
     WHEREAS, the loss of prime farmland threatens Hawaii's ability to grow its own food; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is imperative to ensure Hawaii's food security for future generations by permitting food bearing trees to be planted in public places; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that government agencies are encouraged to plant food bearing trees on lands owned or controlled by the State or a county; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that government agencies are requested to examine liability implications for any injury to any person arising from the person's harvesting from food bearing trees planted on lands owned or controlled by the State or a county, unless the injury results from gross negligence on the part of the State or a county; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Mayor of each county in the State, and Chairperson of the Board of Agriculture.
