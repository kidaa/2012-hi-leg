TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO LAND PRESERVATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii Kai is one of the most developed areas on the island of Oahu and in the State.  In recent years, numerous new single-family and condominium developments have been built in the area.  As in other population centers on the island of Oahu such as Ewa Beach, Mililani, Kapolei, Aiea, and Pearl City, traffic congestion to and from the urban core has been a long recognized problem.  The strain on county resources caused by the dense population in Hawaii Kai, such as the cost of sewage and water systems, is also well recognized.
     The legislature further finds that the purchase of land to preserve open space or to prevent over-development is not a novel idea.  Some past examples of the purchase or attempted purchase of lands for an important public purpose include Waimea Valley Park, Paradise Park, and Punaluu Beach.  In those instances, the State prioritized the preservation of unique habitats and open spaces over further development.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to purchase the remaining open space in Hawaii Kai presently owned by Kamehameha Schools to preserve the land as open space.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $         or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 to purchase the remaining open space in Hawaii Kai owned by Kamehameha Schools to preserve the land as open space.
     The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of land and natural resources for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
