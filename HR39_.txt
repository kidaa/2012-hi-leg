HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE CITY AND COUNTY TO ORDAIN AN ORDINANCE INCREASING PENALTIES FOR VEHICLE AND MOPED NOISE IN HOSPITAL ZONES.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, there is a proliferation of the presence and operation of vehicles and mopeds in hospital zones; and
 
     WHEREAS, some of the vehicles and mopeds have been equipped with aftermarket mufflers emitting excessive noise in violation of law including sections 291-22 to 291-24.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes and section 15-19.28, Revised Ordinances of Honolulu; and
 
     WHEREAS, the excessive noise also creates noise pollution and disturbs hospital patients, staff, and surrounding residential neighborhoods;
 
     WHEREAS, recent studies suggest that a quiet hospital environment can reduce patient recovery time and loud neonatal wards are believed to delay development in premature babies; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Honolulu City Council is requested to amend the Traffic Code, Chapter 15, Revised Ordinances of Honolulu, to provide for increased penalties for drivers creating excessive noise within one hundred feet of a hospital; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to Mayor and the Chairperson of the Council of the City and County of Honolulu.
