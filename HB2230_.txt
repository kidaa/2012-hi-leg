TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO CANCER.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that after Congress passed the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Act in 1990, which led to the creation of cancer screening programs in all fifty states, the legislature established the Hawaii breast and cervical cancer control program in 1997.  From 1997 to 2001, the Hawaii breast and cervical cancer control program screened approximately two thousand women.  Following the enactment of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000, P.L. 106-354, which allowed states to provide coverage for treatment costs of eligible women diagnosed through breast and cervical cancer screening programs through their respective state medicaid programs, the legislature established the breast and cervical cancer treatment program, now known as the comprehensive breast and cervical cancer control program.  Over the past few years, the program has screened approximately 1,275 women each year.  Despite the loss of one of its providers, Hawaii Medical Center, the program anticipates to continue screening between one thousand one hundred to one thousand two hundred women annually.
     The legislature further finds that according to the department of human services med-QUEST division, from July 2010 to June 2011, the State paid a total of $80,487.47 for eight women under the comprehensive breast and cervical cancer control program, which averages to $10,060.93 per person.  Even though the amount of expenditures varies from quarter to quarter and year to year and depends on the number and severity of each medical case, based on the number of women the comprehensive breast and cervical cancer control program has screened annually and the available data from the department of human services, $100,000 would be the estimated amount needed for comprehensive treatment in the State.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds for the comprehensive breast and cervical cancer control program to continue its valuable services of screening, educating, and conducting outreach on breast and cervical cancer.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $100,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the comprehensive breast and cervical cancer control program.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of human services for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
