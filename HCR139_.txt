RESOLUTION
 
 
EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE MUSEUM AND CULTURAL CENTER'S INTENTION TO BUILD A SELF-SUSTAINED INTERACTIVE SCIENCE MUSEUM ON OAHU.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, aerospace is a strategic and timely growth industry for the State that requires proactive, coordinated, and sustained action to fully realize the significant scientific, educational, and commercial benefits that the aerospace industry can bring to the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii's strategic assets include its unique location, moon- and Mars-like terrain, resident expertise covering a broad range of aerospace-related technologies, world-class telescopes, and long standing ties with space-faring nations throughout the Asia-Pacific region; and
 
     WHEREAS, local aerospace companies are equipped with the technical talent and state of the art infrastructure to develop next generation electro‑optic technologies, space surveillance and defense systems, command and control networks, and other resources and capabilities that can be adapted for military and civilian aerospace applications; and
 
     WHEREAS, major aerospace corporations currently established in Hawaii are looking to expand their operations in the State as a bridge to Asia-Pacific markets, especially in the development and delivery of advanced systems for aviation maintenance and training, air traffic control, satellite communications, and deep space tracking, surveillance and reconnaissance; and
 
     WHEREAS, to effectively address Hawaii's current economic malaise, the State's limited funding resources should be invested in strategic growth industries that can attract substantial federal and private sector investments, support high-paying and sustainable employment opportunities for local residents, develop creative opportunities to inspire and train students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics related fields, and expand and diversify research and commercial development programs at universities and businesses statewide; and
 
     WHEREAS, no current state or private organization exists whose primary goals are to:
 
(1)  Teach the general public extended learning in interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics principles through discovery in space exploration and aerospace development;
 
(2)  Make innovative science, technology, engineering, and mathematics accessible to the public through teaching, conferences and participatory learning integrated with the scientific community;
 
(3)  Build cultural understanding and international collaboration by teaching world cultures and their contributions to space exploration and aerospace development; and
 
(4)  Inspire involvement in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields to develop a technologically proficient workforce; now, therefore,
 
BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-seventh Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Legislature supports the International Space Museum and Cultural Center's intention to build a self-sustained interactive science museum on Oahu to promote cultural understanding and peaceful cooperation between nations and individuals through inspirational science, technology, engineering and mathematics education, and discovery in space exploration collaborations; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the International Space Museum and Cultural Center is requested to provide the Legislature with a comprehensive execution plan detailing its intended scope, State and community integration, international partnerships, construction plans, and costs for evaluation of possible resource allocation no later than December 10, 2012; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that all state agencies and departments are requested to aid in the development of the comprehensive plan by:
 
(1)  Facilitating communication between private, county, state, national, and international organizations and the International Space Museum and Cultural Center;
 
(2)  Providing data and other information to the International Space Museum and Cultural Center development; and
 
(3)  Building integrative strategies between state agencies and the International Space Museum and Cultural Center; and
