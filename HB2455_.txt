TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE STATE CODE OF ETHICS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The purpose of this Act is to allow persons with knowledge and expertise the State needs to serve as members of state advisory or working groups without being foreclosed by the requirements, restrictions, or prohibitions imposed by the State's Code of Ethics.
     The legislature finds that the public interest is disserved when persons with knowledge or experience the State needs must forego providing that needed assistance, because they may stand to gain financially as a result of the advice they give, or the recommendations they make, to help state officials or agencies formulate sound public policy, enact laws or adopt administrative rules, or implement laws or rules.
     The definition of "employee" in part II of chapter 84, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to except from that definition and the provisions of the State's Code of Ethics, persons who serve on advisory or working groups that are convened solely for the purpose of commenting, sharing technical knowledge or experience, or formulating recommendations.
     SECTION 2.  Section 84-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending the definition of "employee" to read as follows:
     ""Employee" means any nominated, appointed, or elected officer or employee of the State, including members of boards, commissions, and committees, and employees under contract to the State or of the constitutional convention, but excluding legislators, delegates to the constitutional convention, justices [and], judges[.], and members of groups convened by a statute or resolution, an executive order or proclamation, or the invitation of the legislature, or the governor or another state officer, solely for the purpose of providing advice or comments to, or formulating recommendations for, the legislature, the governor, or a state department, agency, or officer."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
