STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the department of labor and industrial relations does not fully understand the retirement processes of the national guard, especially in relation to appropriate documentation.  Specifically, the department requires the submission of a DD form 214 from all retired national guard employees that apply for unemployment benefits.  However, DD form 214 is provided to only those military members who retire from active duty status.  Many national guard employees retire on a guard and reserve status and are provided with an NGB form 22 for documentation purposes.
     The purpose of this Act is to require the department of labor and industrial relations to update its administrative rules to ensure that appropriate documentation is requested of national guard retirees.
     SECTION 2.  Prior to January 1, 2013, the director of labor and industrial relations, after consultation with the state department of defense, shall update the administrative rules to ensure that the policies and forms of the department of labor and industrial relations relating to employment security law accurately reflect the various separation options afforded to and documentation required of national guard members.  Rules adopted for the purposes of this section shall be exempt from the public notice and hearing provisions of chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes.
     SECTION 3.  The director of labor and industrial relations shall submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2013 to provide details on the rules adopted pursuant to this Act.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
