REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT TO CONVENE A TASK FORCE TO EXAMINE MANAGEMENT POLICIES REGARDING THE USE OF OVERTIME BY STATE AND COUNTY EMPLOYEES.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Hawaii Employees' Retirement System has an unfunded liability of approximately $8,200,000,000; and

     WHEREAS, a small number of excessive overtime cases can drive up the costs of the Employees' Retirement System significantly; and
 
     WHEREAS, overtime is authorized by supervisors, and thus management of employees' time and work attendance is a critical factor in the determination of overtime; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Human Resources Development is requested to convene a task force to examine management policies regarding the use of overtime by state and county employees; and
