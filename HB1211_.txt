STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO PLANNING.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that actions taken by state agencies, though motivated by a desire to improve the quality of life for our community, sometimes result in unintended adverse effects.  To minimize or prevent these negative impacts, state agencies should consider community plans already in place when planning future actions. 
     The purpose of this Act is to require state agencies to consider existing community plans when planning future actions that may impact a specific community.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 26, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§26-     State agency action; community plans.  (a)  During its planning process for, and prior to, action that will impact a community, a state agency shall review all existing community plans.  The state agency shall consider the provisions in each plan, make reasonable efforts to conform to the provisions of each plan when possible, and report, in writing, areas where its intended action will conflict with the provisions of each plan. 
     (b)  For the purposes of this section:
     "Action" means the implementation of a program, project, or initiative by a state agency. 
     "Community plan" means an existing plan, intended to improve the quality of life within that community in some manner, which has been finalized and made publicly available, in written or online form, on January 1, 2006, or thereafter, that meets at least one of the following criteria:
     (1)  A plan developed by the community in partnership with other government entities, including state agencies;
     (2)  A plan developed by the community in response to a government request, including legislative resolutions; or
     (3)  A plan developed by the neighborhood board or other organization within the community.
     "State agency" means an office, division, department, or instrumentality of the State." 
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.      SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
