TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO COUNTIES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The purpose of this Act is to provide the counties with the authority to pass notice of defect ordinances mandating written notification of defects and obstructions on or in county roadways, streets, highways, bridges, culverts, sidewalks, walkways, parks, playgrounds, or structures as a prerequisite to a claim or filing suit for damages to person or property against a county.  Requiring written notice as a prerequisite to filing suit would preclude the assertion of a claim of "constructive notice" against the counties for unknown or unreported defects or conditions.  A plaintiff or claimant would be required to show that written notice of a defect or obstruction was provided to the proper county designee.  The written notice requirement will serve as a prerequisite or condition precedent to filing a negligence action or claim against a county.
     Claims for "trips and falls" on county property are successively increasing.  With limited resources and manpower, it is impossible for the counties to proactively inspect all county property.  This bill balances the interests of all parties by aiding the counties in identifying problematic areas, while tasking the counties with the responsibility to remediate or address the identified areas within a specific time period.
     Several states have granted their municipalities the authority to implement prior written notice of defect laws or ordinances.  This amendment to section 46-1.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, would grant the counties the authority to pass similar ordinances with the written notice of defect requirements.
     SECTION 2.  Section 46-1.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§46-1.5  General powers and limitation of the counties.  Subject to general law, each county shall have the following powers and shall be subject to the following liabilities and limitations:
     (1)  Each county shall have the power to frame and adopt a charter for its own self-government that shall establish the county executive, administrative, and legislative structure and organization, including but not limited to the method of appointment or election of officials, their duties, responsibilities, and compensation, and the terms of their office;

    (19)  Each county shall have the power to:
         (A)  Construct, purchase, take on lease, lease, sublease, or in any other manner acquire, manage, maintain, or dispose of buildings for county purposes, sewers, sewer systems, pumping stations, waterworks, including reservoirs, wells, pipelines, and other conduits for distributing water to the public, lighting plants, and apparatus and appliances for lighting streets and public buildings, and manage, regulate, and control the same;
         (B)  Regulate and control the location and quality of all appliances necessary to the furnishing of water, heat, light, power, telephone, and telecommunications service to the county;

         (D)  Open, close, construct, or maintain county highways or charge toll on county highways; provided that all revenues received from a toll charge shall be used for the construction or maintenance of county highways;
    (20)  Each county shall have the power to regulate the renting, subletting, and rental conditions of property for places of abode by ordinance;
    (21)  Unless otherwise provided by law, each county shall have the power to establish by ordinance the order of succession of county officials in the event of a military or civil disaster;
    (22)  Each county shall have the power to sue and be sued in its corporate name;
    (23)  Each county shall have the power to establish and maintain waterworks and sewer works; to collect rates for water supplied to consumers and for the use of sewers; to install water meters whenever deemed expedient; provided that owners of premises having vested water rights under existing laws appurtenant to the premises shall not be charged for the installation or use of the water meters on the premises; to take over from the State existing waterworks systems, including water rights, pipelines, and other appurtenances belonging thereto, and sewer systems, and to enlarge, develop, and improve the same;
     (24) (A)  Each county may impose civil fines, in addition to criminal penalties, for any violation of county ordinances or rules after reasonable notice and requests to correct or cease the violation have been made upon the violator.  Any administratively imposed civil fine shall not be collected until after an opportunity for a hearing under chapter 91.  Any appeal shall be filed within thirty days from the date of the final written decision.  These proceedings shall not be a prerequisite for any civil fine or injunctive relief ordered by the circuit court;
         (B)  Each county by ordinance may provide for the addition of any unpaid civil fines, ordered by any court of competent jurisdiction, to any taxes, fees, or charges, with the exception of fees or charges for water for residential use and sewer charges, collected by the county.  Each county by ordinance may also provide for the addition of any unpaid administratively imposed civil fines, which remain due after all judicial review rights under section 91-14 are exhausted, to any taxes, fees, or charges, with the exception of water for residential use and sewer charges, collected by the county.  The ordinance shall specify the administrative procedures for the addition of the unpaid civil fines to the eligible taxes, fees, or charges and may require hearings or other proceedings.  After addition of the unpaid civil fines to the taxes, fees, or charges, the unpaid civil fines shall not become a part of any taxes, fees, or charges.  The county by ordinance may condition the issuance or renewal of a license, approval, or permit for which a fee or charge is assessed, except for water for residential use and sewer charges, on payment of the unpaid civil fines.  Upon recordation of a notice of unpaid civil fines in the bureau of conveyances, the amount of the civil fines, including any increase in the amount of the fine which the county may assess, shall constitute a lien upon all real property or rights to real property belonging to any person liable for the unpaid civil fines.  The lien in favor of the county shall be subordinate to any lien in favor of any person recorded or registered prior to the recordation of the notice of unpaid civil fines and senior to any lien recorded or registered after the recordation of the notice.  The lien shall continue until the unpaid civil fines are paid in full or until a certificate of release or partial release of the lien, prepared by the county at the owner's expense, is recorded.  The notice of unpaid civil fines shall state the amount of the fine as of the date of the notice and maximum permissible daily increase of the fine.  The county shall not be required to include a social security number, state general excise taxpayer identification number, or federal employer identification number on the notice.  Recordation of the notice in the bureau of conveyances shall be deemed, at such time, for all purposes and without any further action, to procure a lien on land registered in land court under chapter 501.  After the unpaid civil fines are added to the taxes, fees, or charges as specified by county ordinance, the unpaid civil fines shall be deemed immediately due, owing, and delinquent and may be collected in any lawful manner.  The procedure for collection of unpaid civil fines authorized in this paragraph shall be in addition to any other procedures for collection available to the State and county by law or rules of the courts;
         (C)  Each county may impose civil fines upon any person who places graffiti on any real or personal property owned, managed, or maintained by the county.  The fine may be up to $1,000 or may be equal to the actual cost of having the damaged property repaired or replaced.  The parent or guardian having custody of a minor who places graffiti on any real or personal property owned, managed, or maintained by the county shall be jointly and severally liable with the minor for any civil fines imposed hereunder.  Any such fine may be administratively imposed after an opportunity for a hearing under chapter 91, but such a proceeding shall not be a prerequisite for any civil fine ordered by any court.  As used in this subparagraph, "graffiti" means any unauthorized drawing, inscription, figure, or mark of any type intentionally created by paint, ink, chalk, dye, or similar substances;
         (D)  At the completion of an appeal in which the county's enforcement action is affirmed and upon correction of the violation if requested by the violator, the case shall be reviewed by the county agency that imposed the civil fines to determine the appropriateness of the amount of the civil fines that accrued while the appeal proceedings were pending.  In its review of the amount of the accrued fines, the county agency may consider:
              (i)  The nature and egregiousness of the violation;
             (ii)  The duration of the violation;
            (iii)  The number of recurring and other similar violations;
             (iv)  Any effort taken by the violator to correct the violation;
              (v)  The degree of involvement in causing or continuing the violation;
             (vi)  Reasons for any delay in the completion of the appeal; and
            (vii)  Other extenuating circumstances.
              The civil fine that is imposed by administrative order after this review is completed and the violation is corrected shall be subject to judicial review, notwithstanding any provisions for administrative review in county charters;
         (E)  After completion of a review of the amount of accrued civil fine by the county agency that imposed the fine, the amount of the civil fine determined appropriate, including both the initial civil fine and any accrued daily civil fine, shall immediately become due and collectible following reasonable notice to the violator.  If no review of the accrued civil fine is requested, the amount of the civil fine, not to exceed the total accrual of civil fine prior to correcting the violation, shall immediately become due and collectible following reasonable notice to the violator, at the completion of all appeal proceedings;
         (F)  If no county agency exists to conduct appeal proceedings for a particular civil fine action taken by the county, then one shall be established by ordinance before the county shall impose the civil fine;
    (25)  Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any county mayor, by executive order, may exempt donors, provider agencies, homeless facilities, and any other program for the homeless under part XVII of chapter 346 from real property taxes, water and sewer development fees, rates collected for water supplied to consumers and for use of sewers, and any other county taxes, charges, or fees; provided that any county may enact ordinances to regulate and grant the exemptions granted by this paragraph;
    (26)  Any county may establish a captive insurance company pursuant to article 19, chapter 431; [and]
    (27)  Each county shall have the power to enact and enforce ordinances regulating towing operations[.]; and
    (28)  (A)  Each county shall have the power to enact ordinances; provided that no civil action shall be maintained against a county for damages or injuries to person or property sustained by reason of any property owned, maintained, or controlled by a county, including but not limited to any roadway, street, highway, bridge, culvert, sidewalk, walkway, park, or playground, or because of any apparatus, furnishings, fixtures or improvements thereon being defective, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed, unless:
              (i)  Written notice that defective, unsafe, dangerous, or obstructed condition was received by the county's designee; and
             (ii)  The county failed or neglected to:  repair, remove, or eliminate the defect, the out-of-repair or unsafe condition, or the danger or obstruction complained of; or otherwise undertake such other reasonable remedial action within a reasonable time to warn or prevent the public from being injured after receiving such notice.
         (B)  With regard to written notice, the county enacting the ordinance shall keep an indexed record, in a separate book, of all written notices received by the county's designee. The record shall include the date of receipt of the notice, the nature and location of the condition stated to exist, and the name and address of the person from whom the notice is received. All such written notices shall be indexed according to the location of the alleged defective, unsafe, or dangerous or obstructed condition.
         (C)  This paragraph shall be applicable notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of state law, whether general, special or local, county ordinance, or any limitation contained in the provisions of any city charter."
     SECTION 3.  This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun, before its effective date.
     SECTION 4.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
