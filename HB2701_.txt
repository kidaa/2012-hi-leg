TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO DOMESTIC RELATIONS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in 2011, Act 1, Session Laws of Hawaii 2011 ("Act 1") was enacted into law.  Act 1 established the status of civil unions in this State, which granted eligible couples "all the same rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities under law, whether derived from statutes, administrative rules, court decisions, the common law, or any other source of civil law, as are granted to those who contract, obtain a license, and are solemnized pursuant to chapter 572", Hawaii Revised Statutes.
     The legislature recognizes that the State, over time, has woven into our laws a collection of rights, benefits, and obligations applicable to married couples and families.  Through Act 1, the legislature intended that these rights and benefits be applied identically to civil union partners.  As correctly stated by the house committee on judiciary in Standing Committee Report No. 156 (2011), "It is the intention of your Committee that this measure be liberally construed to provide equality of rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities to the partners of a civil union.  It is not the intention of your Committee to omit any substantive rights, benefits, protections, or responsibilities with respect to the application of this new chapter to any current law, including any law relating to parent-child relationships."
     The purpose of this Act is to assure that the original intent of Act 1 is fulfilled by making clarifying amendments to select statutory provisions to:
     (1)  Settle potential confusion regarding the scope of Act 1's intent; and
     (2)  Clarify statutory language governing procedures and processes to facilitate the implementation of Act 1.
In making these amendments, it is the intent of the legislature to reconfirm and clarify the original intent of Act 1.  Nothing about this Act should be interpreted to weaken or lessen any of the protections, obligations, rights, and responsibilities governed by Act 1.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 572B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "572B‑    Construction.  (a)  This chapter shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purpose, which is to provide partners to a civil union with the rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities afforded or recognized by the law of Hawaii to those who contract, obtain a license, and are solemnized pursuant to chapter 572.
     (b)  Selected amendments to statutes, or failure to amend all or portions of statutes, to include references to this chapter, civil unions, or civil union partners, shall not be interpreted as legislative intent to exclude any rights, benefits, protections, or responsibilities from the scope of section 572B-9 or this chapter.
     §572B‑    Transition from reciprocal beneficiary relationship to civil union for same persons.  (a)  When two persons terminate their reciprocal beneficiary relationship and enter into a civil union or have their union recognized as a civil union, and both events occur substantially concurrently:
     (1)  All rights, benefits, or obligations that were applicable to the persons based on their reciprocal beneficiary relationship that are also applicable to the persons based on their civil union relationship pursuant to section 572B-9, shall be deemed continuous, and any reference to the date of commencement of the right, benefit, or obligation shall be deemed to refer to the date the persons accrued the right, benefit, or obligation under the reciprocal beneficiary relationship;
     (2)  For purposes of calculating the duration of a qualifying relationship, including with respect to elective shares under section 560:2-202, but excluding calculation for purposes of divorce, annulment, or divorce proceedings, the duration of the qualifying relationship shall be deemed to commence as of the date of certificate of reciprocal beneficiary relationship; and
     (3)  For any right or benefit for which there is a waiting period or probationary period, including but not limited to health insurance, no person shall treat the conversion of a reciprocal beneficiary relationship to a civil union as a change in status that restarts the waiting period or probationary period solely on the basis of the change in status.
     (b)  When two persons terminate their reciprocal beneficiary relationship and subsequently enter into a civil union or have their union recognized as a civil union, and there are fewer than thirty days between the two events:
     (1)  All rights, benefits, or obligations that were applicable to the persons based on their reciprocal beneficiary relationship that are also applicable to the persons based on their civil union relationship pursuant to section 572B-9, shall be deemed continuous, and any reference to the date of commencement of the right, benefit, or obligation shall be deemed to refer to the date the persons accrued the right, benefit, or obligation under the reciprocal beneficiary relationship;
     (2)  For purposes of calculating the duration of a qualifying relationship, including with respect to elective shares under section 560:2-202, but excluding calculation for purposes of divorce, annulment, or divorce proceedings, the duration of the qualifying relationship shall be deemed to commence as of the date of certificate of reciprocal beneficiary relationship; provided that the gap between the qualifying relationship shall be subtracted from this period; and
     (3)  For any right or benefit for which there is a waiting period or probationary period, including but not limited to health insurance, the conversion of a reciprocal beneficiary relationship to a civil union may restart the waiting period or probationary period.
     (c)  When two persons terminate their reciprocal beneficiary relationship and subsequently enter into a civil union or have their union recognized as a civil union, and there are thirty or more days between the two events:
     (1)  The rights, benefits, or obligations that were applicable to the persons based on their reciprocal beneficiary relationship that are also applicable to the persons based on their civil union relationship pursuant to section 572B-9, shall not be deemed continuous;
     (2)  For purposes of calculating the duration of a qualifying relationship, including with respect to elective shares under section 560:2-202, but excluding calculation for purposes of divorce, annulment, or divorce proceedings, the duration of the qualifying relationship shall be deemed to commence as of the date of certificate of reciprocal beneficiary relationship; provided that the gap between the qualifying relationship shall be subtracted from this period; and
     (3)  For any right or benefit for which there is a waiting period or probationary period, including but not limited to health insurance, the conversion of a reciprocal beneficiary relationship to a civil union may restart the waiting period or probationary period."
     SECTION 3.  Chapter 584, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§584‑    Child of parents in a civil union.  The rights and obligations of civil union partners with respect to a child of whom either partner becomes the parent during the term of the civil union shall be the same as those of a married couple with respect to a child of whom either spouse or partner becomes the parent during the marriage, including the presumption that a partner of a civil union is presumed to be the natural parent of a child conceived by the other partner where the biological parent and the nonbiological partner are or have been in a civil union and:
     (1)  The child is born while the civil union is in effect, or within three hundred days after the civil union is terminated by death, annulment, declaration of invalidity, or divorce, or after a decree of separation is entered by a court; or
     (2)  The nonbiological partner has shown indicia of commitment to be a parent to the child."

     SECTION 5.  Section 88-4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§88-4  Medical aid, etc., when free.  Every recipient of any retirement allowance or pension payable by the State or by any county or by any other governmental body or agency created by or under the laws of the State who is actually and solely dependent upon the recipient's retirement allowance or pension for the recipient's maintenance and support or whose total income in whatever form or from whatever source received, including but not limited to, the recipient's retirement allowance or pension and any income of the recipient's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary is less than $2,400 a year shall, for the recipient and the recipient's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, be entitled to free medical treatment from any government physician employed by the State or any county and to free hospitalization at any state hospital or at a hospital where county patients are treated at county expense in the county wherein the recipient resides.
