TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO COUNTIES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Article VIII, section 2 of the Hawaii Constitution states, in relevant part:
     Each political subdivision shall have the power to frame and adopt a charter for its own self-government within such limits and under such procedures as may be provided by general law. . . .
     Charter provisions with respect to a political subdivision's executive, legislative and administrative structure and organization shall be superior to statutory provisions, subject to the authority of the legislature to enact general laws allocating and reallocating powers and functions.
     The purpose of this Act is to authorize the counties to appoint their respective personnel directors pursuant to their respective county charter.  The legislature finds that the grant of this authority is within the purview of the counties' executive and administrative structures and organization, and is therefore supported by and consistent with the principle of county self-governance established in article VIII, section 2, of the Hawaii Constitution.
     SECTION 2.  Section 76-75, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§76-75  Personnel director.  The merit appeals board or the mayor of each county, as prescribed by the charter of each county, shall appoint and may at pleasure remove a personnel director, who shall be the chief administrative officer of the department of civil service.  The director [shall], at the time of the director's appointment, and thereafter, shall be thoroughly familiar with the principles and methods of personnel administration and shall believe in applying merit principles and scientific administrative methods to public personnel administration."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
