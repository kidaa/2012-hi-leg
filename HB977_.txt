TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE WORKS OF ART SPECIAL FUND.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Since its inception in 1989, the works of art special fund has provided a dedicated funding source for the art in public places and relocatable works of arts programs.  Existing state law requires one per cent of the capital improvement appropriations for the construction cost element that are designated for the construction or renovation of state buildings to be transferred to the special fund, with certain exceptions.  Over time, more than adequate reserves of works of art have been acquired.  As a result, the legislature finds that the purchase of new art work for renovations is unnecessary.
     The purpose of this Act is to limit the required one per cent transfer of funds into the works of art special fund by specifying that the required transfer of funds shall apply solely to capital improvement appropriations designated for the construction of state buildings.      SECTION 2.  Section 103-8.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  There is created a works of art special fund, into which shall be transferred one per cent of all state fund appropriations for capital improvements designated for the construction cost element; provided that this transfer shall apply only to capital improvement appropriations that are designated for the construction [or renovation] of state buildings.  The one per cent transfer requirement shall not apply to appropriations from the passenger facility charge special fund established by section 261-5.5 and the rental motor vehicle customer facility charge special fund established under section 261-5.6."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
