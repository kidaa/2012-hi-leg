TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HOUSING POLICY.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Pursuant to Act 191, Session Laws of Hawaii 2010, the legislature appropriated moneys from the emergency and budget reserve fund to maintain levels of essential programs for education, human services, health, and the public welfare.  These moneys included funds to provide for the development and implementation of a housing first pilot program for chronically homeless individuals.  As of December 2010, the new governor is in the process of releasing the funds appropriated pursuant to Act 191.  However, due to the delay in the release of funds the department of human services may not have enough time to expend the funds for the housing first pilot program before they lapse at the end of the 2010-2011 fiscal year.  This situation would severely curtail the ability of the department and the Hawaii public housing authority to help the chronically homeless individuals recognized by the legislature as being in dire need of housing services.
     The purpose of this Act is to extend to December 31, 2011 the date on which the appropriation for the housing first pilot program will lapse to ensure the fulfillment of the legislature's intent in passing Act 191.
SECTION 2.  Act 191, Session Laws of Hawaii 2010, is amended by amending section 41 to read as follows:
     "SECTION 41.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2010[.]; provided that the appropriation made for the housing first pilot program in section 14 of this Act shall not lapse at the end of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made; provided further that moneys appropriated for the housing first pilot program in section 14 of this Act that are unencumbered as of December 31, 2011 shall lapse at the close of business on that date."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
