     (1)  Fines and forfeitures for violations that occur on state off-street parking facilities, parks, airports, and harbors that are subject to enforcement by the State; and
     (2)  Fines and forfeitures that are required by law to be paid into a special, revolving, or trust fund.
No county shall be entitled to any portion of the fines and forfeitures described in this subsection."
