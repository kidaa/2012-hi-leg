HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND THE CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU TO INSPECT, CLEAN, AND FIX THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM IN EAST HONOLULU.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, starting on March 5, 2012, a week-long storm that included hail and a tornado swept across the State and flooded homes, closed roads, and contributed to the loss of electricity in numerous areas, affecting many businesses and communities; and
 
     WHEREAS, in valleys and low-lying areas, particularly in East Honolulu, extensive flood damage was sustained to homes and property, resulting in financial and emotional hardships for many residents; and
 
     WHEREAS, flooding in the valleys and low-lying areas of East Honolulu has worsened over the years because antiquated and inadequate sewage and drainage systems have not been able to accommodate the increasing flow from the East Honolulu community; and
 
     WHEREAS, while these sewage and drainage systems are occasionally cleaned of debris, the primary need is to conduct a comprehensive study of the drainage system to identify its deficiencies and implement necessary facilities, maintenance, and operational upgrades; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that to prevent future flooding in East Honolulu the Department of Transportation with cooperation from the City and County of Honolulu's Department of Facility Maintenance is requested to inspect and study the East Honolulu drainage system, and take necessary steps to improve it.  This shall include, among other things:
(1)  Inspecting and analyzing the drainage system of East Honolulu, including by appropriate engineers and other experts, to:
 
(A)  Determine when it was constructed, its size, its designed capacity, and areas it was originally intended to serve;
 
(B)  Identifying constrictions within the system that contribute to the flooding, such as 90-degree bends;
 
(C)  Determining present and projected system demand by, among other things, identifying lateral drain lines connecting into the drainage system and determining if they were part of the original system or added later; identifying all inlets that contribute storm water to the drainage system; and determining whether an increase of areas served by it due to modernization and expansion since its installation contribute to its deficiencies; and
 
(D)  Identifying the source of debris in the drainage system and addressing its reduction and removal;
 
(2)  Obtaining input from communities in East Honolulu affected by flooding including residents who live alongside the drainage system; and
 
(3)  Developing and implementing a plan to correct deficiencies, including addressing the lack of capacity to meet demand, employing needed storm water diversion solutions, making necessary facilities improvements to improve water flow, addressing ongoing needs for debris minimization and removal, providing regular inspections, and implementing a mechanism to gather input from communities affected by flooding; and
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Transportation with cooperation from the City and County of Honolulu's Department of Facility Maintenance shall submit a
report of its findings, recommendations, including any proposed legislation, and actions taken to the Legislature no later than 20 days prior to the convening of the 2013 Regular Session; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu, Director of Transportation, and Director of the Department of Facility Maintenance of the City and County of Honolulu.
