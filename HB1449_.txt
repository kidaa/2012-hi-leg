TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HOMELESSNESS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Aloha United Way 211 is an information and referral service that is available statewide, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.  Dialing 2-1-1 immediately provides callers with access to a specialist who directs callers to more than four thousand programs and services as appropriate to their needs.  The legislature finds that Aloha United Way 211 offers vital information to people seeking referrals or access to homeless shelters, food pantries, rent payment assistance, health insurance, and other public assistance programs.
     In 2009, over forty-two thousand people called Aloha United Way 211. In the first six months of 2010, over twenty thousand people called Aloha United Way 211.  With the downturn in the economy, many of these callers desired assistance with basic human needs such as shelter and food.  Given the current economic situation in Hawaii, these questions and requests for help cannot go unanswered.  The legislature finds that funding for a full-time homeless care coordinator position is needed to help manage the large volume of calls and the sheer number of people requiring assistance in accessing critical and essential services.
     The purpose of this Act is to better assist individuals facing or experiencing homelessness by funding a full-time 211 homeless care coordinator position at Aloha United Way.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013, as a chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes, grant to Aloha United Way 211 to fund a full-time 211 homeless care coordinator position in Aloha United Way's office.
     SECTION 3.  The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of human services for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
