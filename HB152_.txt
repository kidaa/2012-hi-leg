TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO CRIMINAL OFFENDERS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that, during the past decade, many states have relied on early release programs as a way to reduce prison overcrowding and relieve pressure on correctional budgets.  During that time, a number of studies have examined the relationship between early release and the rate of recidivism.  Researchers have concluded that early release had no adverse impact on overall recidivism.  Currently, the director of public safety may grant furloughs to felons and misdemeanants with a minimum or lower security classification on a variety of conditions.  This Act will permit the director to release suitable misdemeanants outright after they have served two-thirds of the term imposed by the court.
     The purpose of this Act is to give the State an additional tool to reduce costs associated with the operation of its correctional system.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 353, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§353-    Early release for misdemeanants.  (a)  Upon reasonable belief that a propensity to commit further crimes does not exist, the director may release a committed person sentenced for a misdemeanor offense; provided that the committed person shall serve at least two-thirds of the maximum sentence imposed by the court under section 706-663."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011; provided that section 2 of this Act shall be repealed on June 30, 2014.
