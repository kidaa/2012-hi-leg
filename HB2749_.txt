     (1)  The dog shall be under the control of the patron at all times, on a leash that is tied or fastened to keep the dog within two feet of the patron;
     (2)  The dog shall remain at the patron's seating area and on the floor;
     (3)  The dog shall not interfere with the activities of the restaurant's employees, shall not obstruct any pathways, and shall not enter food preparation areas;
     (4)  The dog shall not relieve itself within the restaurant, bark, or otherwise disturb other patrons; and
     (5)  The dog and patron shall abide by any other conditions that the owner or manager of the restaurant may impose.
     (b)  A restaurant that permits dogs in the restaurant shall post prominently at each entrance a sign displaying the message, "Dogs are allowed in this restaurant."  The restaurant shall post adjacent to that sign the list of conditions in subsection (a), including a clear description of the, if any, additional conditions imposed by the owner or manager of the restaurant.
     (c)  If any of the conditions in subsection (a) are not met, the owner or manager of the restaurant may require the patron to remove the dog from the restaurant.

     (e)  For purposes of this section, the term "restaurant" means any place where food is served or provided to the public at a charge, including outdoor seating areas, regardless of whether the food is consumed on or off the premises.
     (f)  If any provisions of this section conflict with federal law governing service animals, federal law shall prevail."
