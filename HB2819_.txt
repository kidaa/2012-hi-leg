A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE HAWAII COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Hawaii community development authority was established to help determine community development programs; to cooperate with private and other government agencies to implement those community development plans; and increase affordable housing, parks, and public facilities in certain districts.  Pursuant to chapter 206E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the authority is authorized to sell state-controlled real property.  However, under chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the sale of public lands requires the prior approval of the legislature by concurrent resolution after a sale or exchange proposal is made and reviewed.
     The legislature also finds that under certain circumstances the authority may find it profitable or beneficial to expedite a real property transaction.  Such situations have arisen and may arise in the future in the Kakaako community development district.  In anticipation of these opportunities, the legislature finds the need to be informed of the costs and benefits of selling or purchasing various properties located in the Kakaako community development district in order to make decisions regarding the approval of the sale of these public lands.
     The purpose of the Act is to require the authority to determine the costs and benefits of selling and purchasing certain properties within the Kakaako community development district.
     SECTION 2.  The Hawaii community development authority shall determine the costs and benefits of selling and purchasing certain properties within the Kakaako community development district.  The Hawaii community development authority shall submit a report to the legislature, including findings, recommendations, and any proposed legislation, no later than ninety days after the effective date of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
