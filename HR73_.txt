HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE TO IMPLEMENT AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO PROMOTE THE PURCHASE OF HAWAII-GROWN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the State of Hawaii has recognized the importance of a self-sufficient and sustainable economy; and
 
     WHEREAS, approximately ninety per cent of all food consumed in Hawaii is imported into the State; and
 
     WHEREAS,  inexpensive alternatives in food choices often lead to less healthy eating habits which may negatively impact health; and
 
     WHEREAS, although agricultural products grown in Hawaii often cost more than similar imported products, the high quality and freshness of Hawaii grown agricultural products often reflect a philosophy of self-sufficiency, sustainability, and stewardship embodied in Aloha Aina - Love of the Land;  and
 
     WHEREAS, expanding the local purchase of Hawaii grown agricultural products would benefit the State's economy, as well as the farmers or producers of the agricultural products, and would promote healthy living through health eating habits; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that in recognition of the importance of expanding the local market for agricultural products grown in Hawaii, the Department of Agriculture is requested to work with growers and producers of agricultural products grown in Hawaii, federal, state, and county agencies, and relevant private entities to establish a program that provides for the purchase of agricultural products grown in Hawaii by schools, hospitals, military bases, restaurants, retail grocers, and other appropriate consumers; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Agriculture is requested to report to the Legislature on the implementation of the program to expand the local market for agricultural products grown in Hawaii no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Chairperson of the Board of Agriculture, the Director of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism, the Director of Health, the Chairperson of the Board of Education, the Superintendent of Education, the Chairperson of the Executive Committee of the Retail Merchants of Hawaii, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii, the President of the Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation, and the Commander of the United States Pacific Command.
