TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HEALTH INSURANCE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 provides for the establishment by 2014 of health insurance exchanges which will facilitate the purchase and sale of federally qualified health insurance plans and provide a connection between buyers and sellers of those plans.  The intent of the health insurance exchange is to reduce the number of uninsured, to provide a transparent marketplace and consumer education, and to assist individuals with access to programs, premium assistance, tax credits, and cost-sharing reductions.  The legislature finds that the people of Hawaii will be best served by a health insurance exchange that is operated in Hawaii.
     Because a federal grant to support the operations of a health insurance exchange will become available and the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services will determine whether Hawaii can implement a health insurance exchange, the legislature finds that moving forward in the 2011 legislative session with an enabling statute is prudent.
     The purpose of this Act is to establish an authority to implement that policy. 
     SECTION 2.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
