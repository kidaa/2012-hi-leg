     (j)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, whenever a court revokes a person's driver's license pursuant to this section, the examiner of drivers shall not grant to the person a new driver's license until the expiration of the entire period of revocation determined by the court.  After the period of revocation is completed, the person may apply for and the examiner of drivers may grant to the person a new driver's license.
