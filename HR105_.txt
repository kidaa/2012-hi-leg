STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 

HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE TO USE GREEN COFFEE, INSTEAD OF PARCHMENT EQUIVALENT, AS THE BASIS FOR VALUING HAWAII'S COFFEE CROPS.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the United States Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service currently uses the parchment equivalent basis in determining the farm gate value of coffee produced in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, no coffee in Hawaii is sold at the parchment stage, as farmers must remove the parchment in order to sell their coffee; and
 
     WHEREAS, using the parchment equivalent basis is inaccurate and significantly undervalues the coffee crops produced in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, green coffee, the unroasted bean with the parchment removed, is the product that coffee farmers produce; and
 
     WHEREAS, using green coffee as the basis for valuation would be the most accurate representation of the actual value of the coffee crops grown in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, using green coffee as the basis for valuing Hawaii's coffee crops is consistent with how coffee is valued in Hawaii and internationally; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the United States Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service is urged to use green coffee instead of parchment equivalent as the basis for valuing Hawaii's coffee crops; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Administrator of the National Agricultural Statistics Service, United States Representative Mazie Hirono, and the Chairperson of the Hawaii Department of Agriculture.
