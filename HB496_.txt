TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO LAKE WILSON.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Wahiawa reservoir, commonly known as Lake Wilson, is Hawaii's largest reservoir with a 3,000,000,000 gallon capacity.  Given its size, Lake Wilson could provide the water needed for the north shore of Oahu's agricultural expansion, but the condition and quality of the water today limits the crops produced on the north shore.  Nearby landowners hold about 20,000 acres of land that can be used for agricultural production but is now limited to tree crops, corn, and other production items that can use R-2 (disinfected secondary treated effluent) water.  As a result, the response to the demand for more food production in Hawaii has been limited by the land available and the quality of water for production.
     The cleanup of the lake will also lead to greater recreational opportunities, such as fishing, boating, and other water recreation activities.
     The purpose of this Act is to establish a pilot project to improve the water quality of Lake Wilson to acceptable levels.
     SECTION 2.  (a)  There is established a pilot project within the department of land and natural resources for administrative purposes to demonstrate the effectiveness of marine phytoremediation using plants that are native to Hawaii to remove pollutants and improve water clarity in Lake Wilson.
     (b)  The department shall submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2012, on the viability, safety, and effectiveness of the technology on a demonstration scale in the Lake Wilson environment and recommendations, including the costs associated with the recommendations, for continuation or expansion of the project.
     SECTION 3.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 for a pilot project to demonstrate the effectiveness of marine phytoremediation using plants that are native to Hawaii to remove pollutants and improve water clarity in Lake Wilson.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of land and natural resources for the purposes of this Act.

     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
