HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARIES FOR PALAMA SETTLEMENT, THE CHINESE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF HAWAII, AND LILIHA SHINGONJI MISSION.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the State of Hawaii acknowledges the benefits it has derived from organizations that sustain the health of, promote the culture of and respect the people of our multi-cultural State; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Centennial Anniversaries of the Palama Settlement, the Liliha Shingonji Mission, and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii mark a significant milestone in the history of organizations that have represented community stewardship and civic responsibility, and have contributed greatly to achieve the safety, health and prosperity of our State; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii's state and local governments often address issues regarding at-risk youths, homelessness, job creation, peace and safety and its compassion towards our elderly, and the preservation of cultural and spiritual traditions are also of concern for these organizations who have given selflessly to address these needs; and
 
     WHEREAS, Palama Settlement was founded in 1905 by James and Ragna Rath and became fully incorporated in 1910 and constructed on 810 North Vineyard Boulevard in Liliha, Hawaii with the mission to provide facilities, services and programs to support, improve and positively enhance the cultural, social, educational, physical and emotional well being of individuals, families and communities in the surrounding area with programs that have included the State's first public health clinic and free dental care and outpatient services; Palama Settlement has been recognized for 100 years of outreach to the Kalihi and Palama community for providing services to various immigrant communities, including the Japanese, Chinese, Hawaiians, Filipinos, Samoans, Tongans, Laotians, and Micronesians.  Palama Settlement has effectively provided a wide range of educational, recreational, athletic, cultural, social, health services and mentoring for at-risk youth, adults, and seniors that positively enhance the wellbeing of individuals and families, such as the Children's Savings Project, which educates children about finances and civic responsibility; and
 
     WHEREAS, Liliha Shingonji Mission was founded in 1911 by Gishun Yamamoto on Liliha Street and has developed a longstanding reputation for providing its patrons with an exceptional spiritual guidance which has fostered and grown a correspondingly dedicated following, as Hawaii has a strong Japanese religious tradition originating from the surge of immigrants, particularly those native to prefectures Hiroshima, Kumamoto, Okinawa and Yamaguchi, who came to the islands to work in the agriculture industry, now referred to as Odaisama; Liliha Shingonji Mission, known for its exceptional and unique East-West architecture and "Healing Gizo" and formerly referred to as the Daigo Bun Kyo In Temple, renamed by Reverend Mitsumyo Tottori, houses many historical religious memorial tablets that Reverend Tottori wrote during World War II.  Liliha Shingonji Mission has been a safe environment for families to request prayers for family in the army and holds various records known as the "Prayer Book of Names" up until 1958. Liliha Shingonji Mission's heartfelt commitment to preserving its oral and pictorial history through the experiences of its followers and thereby contributing to the rich tapestry that is Hawaii’s heritage has resulted in Liliha Shingonji Mission's longevity of 100 years as of this year; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii was founded in 1911, then known as the Chinese Merchants' Association, with the mission to promote business and economic development in Hawaii, aid Chinese immigrants with the naturalization procedure, uphold the Chinese community, and to share Chinese culture and traditions to the rest of the state of Hawaii.  Located in Chinatown, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce has played an important roles in shaping the State's economic, social and political future, with extensive business relations in China, Taiwan and other Chinese communities in Pacific Rim countries in addition to raising funds to help during disasters in China and providing local financial assistance to affected individuals; its members have consistently aided in the revitalization of Chinatown through community events, such as the successful education programs to the business community and restaurants; the Narcissus Festival, which is the oldest ethnic festival and pageant in the State; the Splendor of China; and the Chamber's involvement with charitable relief and humanitarian efforts; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that this body hereby recognizes, commends and expresses its deepest gratitude to Palama Settlement, Liliha Shingonji Mission, and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii on their Centennial Anniversaries for their many contributions towards the betterment of the lives of the people of Hawaii.
