Report Title:
Foreclosures; Unfair or Deceptive Act or Practice; Title Transfers
 
Description:
Repeals the provision automatically making all violations of the mortgage foreclosure law an unfair or deceptive act or practice, in favor of determinations made on a case-by-case basis.  Establishes a time limit for filing actions to void title transfers of foreclosed property.  Specifies a mortgagor's right to claim that a violation of the mortgage foreclosure law constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice.  Provides that a mortgagee's failure to demonstrate rights of a holder in due course is prima facie evidence of an unfair or deceptive act or practice.  Following the expiration of the mortgage foreclosure dispute resolution program in 2014, specifies certain foreclosure violations as unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and limits the types of violations that may void a title transfer of foreclosed property.
