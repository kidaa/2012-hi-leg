TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that economic stability does not arise solely from income.  Financial assets, including cash savings, stocks, bonds, and home and business equity are all critical components of economic security.  The accumulation of financial assets can offer individuals hope for the future, stimulate growth in all sectors, and enhance the welfare of families and children.  For example, a home is often a family's most valuable asset and forms a large component of household net worth for many Americans.
     The legislature further finds that saving for a down payment on a home is a formidable prospect for too many low- and moderate-income earners in Hawaii.  While developing affordable housing properties is necessary, it is equally important to invest in additional strategies that can expand a family's ability to purchase a home.  Individual development accounts are special savings accounts that match the deposits of low- and moderate-income account holders to save towards certain qualified financial goals.  Individual development accounts have provided proven assistance to families who are saving to purchase a home, pay higher education expenses, and fulfill other asset-building goals.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds for individual development account programs to support asset-building among low- and moderate-income families.
     SECTION 2.  Section 257-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows:
     1.  By adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read:
     ""Department" means the department of human services or any state agency authorized by the department of human services to carry out its duties established by this chapter."
     2.  By amending the definition of "qualified expenditures" to read:

     (5)  One motor vehicle purchase for school or work transportation."
     SECTION 3.  Section 257-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  The income of the household of the individual development account holder shall not exceed [eighty per cent of the area household median income.] an amount determined by the department."
