HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE ENFORCEMENT OF AND SUPPORT FOR THE INTENT OF THE FEDERAL STARK LAW.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Stark Law, passed by the United States Congress in 1989 as a provision of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, bars physician self-referrals for clinical laboratory services under the Medicare program; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Stark Law was enacted as a means to reduce health care costs by barring physician self-referral, the practice of a physician referring a patient to a medical facility in which the physician has a financial interest, including ownership, investment, or a structured compensation arrangement; and
 
     WHEREAS, subsequently amended by:
 
(1)  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which expanded the restriction to a range of additional health services and applied the restriction to both Medicare and Medicaid; and
 
(2)  Section 1877 of the Social Security Act of 1994, which made technical corrections to the 1993 law,
 
the Stark Law comprises three separate provisions that govern physician self-referral for Medicare and Medicaid patients; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Stark Law:
 
(1)  Prohibits a physician, subject to certain exceptions, from making referrals for certain designated health services payable by Medicare to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship;
 
(2)  Prohibits a subject entity from presenting or causing to be presented claims to Medicare, or billing another individual, entity, or third party payer, for those improperly referred services; and
 
(3)  Establishes a number of specific exceptions and grants the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services the authority to create by rule exceptions for financial relationships that do not pose a risk for program or patient abuse; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, amends the Stark Law in several areas by:
 
(1)  Adding a new requirement to the in-office ancillary services exception for referrals of certain diagnostic imaging services;
 
(2)  Substantially limiting the scope of the whole-hospital exception permitting referrals to hospitals with which the referring physician has a financial relationship; and
 
(3)  Requiring the United States Department of Health and Human Services, together with the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, to establish a protocol for health care providers to self-disclose actual or potential violations of the Stark Law; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the United States Office of the Attorney General; United States Department of Health and Human Services; United States Federal Trade Commission; United States Securities and Exchange Commission; United States Internal Revenue Service; State of Hawaii Office of the Attorney General; State of Hawaii Department of Health; and State of Hawaii Department of Human Services, are urged to enforce the Stark Law to the full extent of their statutory and regulatory authority to do so; and
