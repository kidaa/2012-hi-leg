REQUESTING THE GOVERNOR TO RECOGNIZE LOCAL KOREANS BY DIRECTING THE PLACEMENT OF A COMMEMORATIVE PLAQUE DESIGNATING THE FORMER SITE OF THE KOREAN BOARDING SCHOOL FOR BOYS AND THE KOREAN METHODIST CHURCH.
 
 

     WHEREAS, beginning with the first group of 102 on the S.S. Gaelic, which arrived at Honolulu Harbor on January 13, 1903, approximately 7,400 Koreans were admitted to Hawaii through August 1905, and the 1910 census listed 4,533 Koreans living in the Hawaiian Islands; and
 
     WHEREAS, Koreans urged the Hawaiian Methodist Mission to establish a school for Korean boys with the assistance of a $2,000 pledge; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Korean Boarding School for Boys opened its doors to 65 boys in the fall of 1906 at the old North Pacific Institute, or Doctor Hyde's Theological Seminary on Punchbowl Street near Beretania Street, at the present Kalanimoku Building site; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Korean Methodist Church was also located at one of the buildings and the site was commonly known as the Korean Compound; and
 
     WHEREAS, the school changed its name to Korean Central School and admitted girl students in the fall of 1913, the first coeducational institution for Koreans in the world; and
 
     WHEREAS, the school closed its doors in the fall of 1918 and the Korean Methodist Church was relocated to Fort Street; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is fitting to recognize the location of the Korean Boarding School for Boys and the Korean Methodist Church with a bronze plaque; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Governor is requested to direct the placement of a plaque to be funded by the Korean community as follows:

     (2)  The plaque is to be placed at an appropriate site at the Punchbowl Street side of the Kalanimoku Building near the Punchbowl exit; and
 
     (3)  The plaque is to read in English and Korean "Korean Boarding School for Boys and Korean Methodist Church Site, 1906 – 1918"; and
