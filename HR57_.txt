HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
SUPPORTING EFFORTS BY NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT ASSIST IN FINDING OPPORTUNITIES AND SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN HAWAII.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that homelessness is an immediate and pressing problem for many individuals and families in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, the homeless population is a diverse group that includes individuals who are in need of specialized services to address chronic mental and physical illnesses as well as substance abuse; and
 
     WHEREAS, the homeless population also includes individuals, such as veterans or parents with young children, who are in need of specialized social support resources or innovative services tailored for their individual needs; and
 
     WHEREAS, homelessness is a mutual concern among state and federal agencies, community programs and foundations, and the business community, including many non-governmental organizations that deliver pivotal services to the homeless by providing meals, job training and placement, and early childhood education; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Legislature is striving to address long-term
solutions to homelessness, including repairing or building public housing units, providing housing subsidies and services, and creating employment and job training programs; and
    
     WHEREAS, while long-term solutions are vital, the economic downturn facing the State poses challenges to providing adequate funding to government programs addressing homelessness; and
     WHEREAS, non-governmental organizations are often able to organize quickly to aid the homeless and leverage funding from public and private sources to help those less fortunate; and
 
     WHEREAS, many Hawaii organizations currently assist homeless individuals by providing meals, training, jobs, and other services without seeking special recognition for their efforts; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that this body supports the efforts by non-governmental organizations that assist in finding opportunities and solutions to address homelessness in Hawaii; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor's Coordinator on Homelessness, Executive Director of the Hawaii Public Housing Authority, Director of Human Services, Chief Executive Officer of the Affordable Housing and Homeless Alliance, President of Hawaii Youth Services Network, and Executive Director of U.S. Vets Hawaii.
