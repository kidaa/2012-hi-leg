A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HAWAII STATE DOG APPRECIATION DAY.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1. The legislature finds that dogs in Hawaii deserve to be recognized for their many contributions to the people of the State of Hawaii.
     While the legislature finds that dogs, which are the most widely owned domesticated animals in Hawaii are appreciated for their patience, unquestioning loyalty and their capacity for love by becoming extended members of Hawaii's families;  moreover dogs are known for their unmatched record and spirit of service to our citizens.
     The legislature finds that dogs have an impact on the lives of our people everyday, serving those with disabilities by providing living assistance as guide dogs, hearing dogs and service dogs and providing protection. Dogs serve soldiers, law enforcement partners, children and elders who are disabled, detect bombs and drugs, pull victims of tragedy from wreckage in situations of disaster, thereby protecting our freedom. Dogs have earned the title of "Man's Best Friend".
    
     The legislature also finds that dogs are utilized in various forms of therapy and have been shown to aid in increasing recovery for patients suffering from physical, emotional, and social conditions.
     The legislature appreciates the fact that the Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law in 1990 guarantees people with disabilities the right to be accompanied by a service animal in all areas open to the general public and that laws such as these illustrate and support the importance of dogs in our daily lives.
     The purpose of this act is to designate August 26th as Hawaii State Dog Appreciation Day.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 8, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§8-      Hawaii State Dog Appreciation Day.    August 26th shall be known and designated "Hawaii State Dog Appreciation Day".  This day is not and shall not be construed as a state holiday."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
