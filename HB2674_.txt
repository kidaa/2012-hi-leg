TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HUMAN SERVICES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that rate of enrollment for medicaid is quickly growing in Hawaii and across the nation.  Medicaid services in Hawaii alone cost an estimated $1,000,000,000 per year.  The legislature further finds that medicaid is an important program and a safety net for the community, especially children and senior citizens.  However, due to recent budget cuts, many medicaid eligibility worker positions were restricted, slowing the process of verifying the continued eligibility of medicaid applicants and beneficiaries.  As many as eight thousand medicaid recipients in Hawaii may be ineligible for services.
     The purpose of this Act is to provide funding for additional medicaid eligibility workers to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the medicaid program.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $200,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 to fund three full-time equivalent medicaid eligibility worker I positions (3.0 FTE), two full-time equivalent medicaid eligibility worker II positions (2.0 FTE), and one medicaid eligibility worker III position (1.0 FTE).
     SECTION 3.  The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of human services for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
