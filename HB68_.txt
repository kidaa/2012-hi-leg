A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO SEWER SYSTEMS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that sewer fees in Honolulu have been drastically increased to finance the maintenance of the aging sewer system.  The purpose of this Act is to ensure that sewer fees collected from ratepayers are used to improve, repair, upgrade, and retrofit the existing sewer system, and to prevent the expenditure of increased sewer fees to finance new projects outside of the urban core.
     SECTION 2.  No county with a population greater than five hundred thousand shall undertake any sewer system project unless the existing sewer system in the census-designated place that has that county's largest population density has been upgraded and retrofitted to serve current and future capacity.
     For the purposes of this Act:
     "Census-designated place" means a concentration of population identified by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes.
     "Sewer system" means a system of piping, with appurtenances, for collecting and conveying sewage from source to discharge.
     "Sewer system project" means any project to construct a new sewer system, and does not include any improvement or construction project undertaken to satisfy the requirements of this section.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval and shall be repealed on the date the governor issues a proclamation that a county with a population greater than five hundred thousand meets the requirements of section 2 of this Act.
