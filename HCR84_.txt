TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE ADOPTION OF LAWS TO REQUIRE WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM THE LANDOWNER IN ORDER TO HUNT ON PRIVATE LANDS AND TO DEFINE PLACES OF FORMAL HUNTING.
 
 

     WHEREAS, farmers and ranchers have continually experienced problems, including damage and injury caused by trespassing hunters, yet have no recourse against them and are defenseless against claims by the trespassers for incidents on private land despite the trespassers' illegal entry; and
 
     WHEREAS, poaching and agricultural theft have escalated over the years and must be better controlled through proper enforcement and strict sentencing; and
 
     WHEREAS, trespassing hunters also present safety issues for the farmers, ranchers, their families, and workers; and
 
     WHEREAS, existing laws inadequately protect private landowners from bodily injury and damage to property, livestock, and crops as a result of entry onto private property by trespassers engaged in hunting with firearms; and
 
     WHEREAS, private landowners are willing to work with licensed hunters who often assist the landowners in controlling the population of feral ungulates such as pigs, goats, and deer that damage the environment; and
 
     WHEREAS, requiring written permission from private landowners for hunting or other legitimate purposes is the very least that should be done to address the ongoing concerns of property owners relating to trespass; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that laws be adopted to require written permission from landowners in order to hunt on private lands; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that any such law adopted also clarify areas in which hunting may be allowed by defining places of formal hunting; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources and Attorney General.
