     WHEREAS, for more than twenty years, the League of Cities of the Philippines has been a vital force in protecting the interests of cities and has served as the unified voice of cities advocating policies for continuing genuine local autonomy; and
     WHEREAS, the League of Cities of the Philippines has also remained actively committed to seeking opportunities locally and internationally for cooperation in the fields of economics, trade, culture, education, health, tourism, and environmental protection for the purposes of economic and social development of cities in the Philippines; and
 
     WHEREAS, the State of Hawaii and the League of Cities of the Philippines share the common goal of fostering strong and effective local governments by developing relationships to share knowledge and capacities; and
