     WHEREAS, tourism is a vital part of Hawaii's economy; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Pacific region is a vast market for new visitors; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2010 more than fifty-four million Chinese citizens traveled abroad; and
 
     WHEREAS, in that same year, only eight hundred thousand Chinese visitors traveled to the United States and of those, only sixty-two thousand Chinese visitors traveled to Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, reforming the travelers visa process is a cost-effective way to make it easier for more international business and tourists to visit Hawaii and the United States; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Visa Improvements to Stimulate International Tourism to the United States of America Act (VISIT USA Act) would establish a five year multiple entry visa for Chinese visitors, extend the time Canadian retirees can stay in the United States, and make other amendments in the visa process that would increase tourism in the United States; and
 
     WHEREAS, the average visitor from China staying in Hawaii spends approximately $350 a day, the growth in visitors stimulated by the VISIT USA Act could yield an estimated $573,000,000 for the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, the proposed improvements in the VISIT USA Act would help make visiting Hawaii more convenient for many international visitors, thus providing a significant boost to Hawaii's economy through increased commerce and job growth; now, therefore,
