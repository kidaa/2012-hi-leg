TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HEALTH INSURANCE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the health benefits plan for beneficiaries of the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund should be delivered in an integrated manner.  Offering medical benefits and prescription drug benefits to beneficiaries through separate carriers results in a fragmented health care delivery system that may result in higher costs and reduced quality of care.  The purpose of this Act is to integrate medical benefits and prescription drug benefits that are offered to beneficiaries of the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund.
     SECTION 2.  Section 87A-16, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "[[]§87A-16[]]  Health benefits plan; carriers.  (a)  The board shall establish the health benefits plan or plans, which shall be exempt from the minimum group requirements of chapter 431.
     (b)  The board may contract for health benefits plans or provide health benefits through a noninsured schedule of benefits.
     (c)  To the extent the board contracts for health benefits plans, it shall enter into contracts with carriers that provide or administer prescription drug benefits together with medical benefits."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
