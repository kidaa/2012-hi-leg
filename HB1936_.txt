A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO TUITION ASSISTANCE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that each state offers some form of tuition assistance to members of the national guard who pursue a college degree.  Of the fifty states, approximately half of the states offer up to one hundred per cent tuition assistance at in-state or state-supported colleges or universities.  Benefits are subject to available funds and may be suspended when funding runs out. 
     The purpose of this Act is to:
     (1)  Expand the existing tuition assistance program to qualified Hawaii national guard members to include students working toward any degree, with priority given to students working toward their undergraduate degrees; and
     (2)  Appropriate funds to provide tuition assistance to students who are members of the Hawaii national guard.
     SECTION 2.  Section 121-45, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  The adjutant general, subject to the availability of funds, may award tuition assistance to qualified enlisted persons, warrant officers, and [company grade] officers [(0-1 through 0-3)] in the Hawaii national guard who are:
     (1)  Residents of the State, as defined by the board of regents pursuant to section [[]304A-402[]]; and
     (2)  [Undergraduate students] Students working toward a degree on any campus of the University of Hawaii.  Students working toward an undergraduate degree shall receive priority consideration for the awarding of available funding for tuition assistance."
     SECTION 3.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $1,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 to provide tuition assistance to members of the Hawaii national guard who are students working toward a degree on any campus of the University of Hawaii system.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of defense for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval; provided that section 3 shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
