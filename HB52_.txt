TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO UNIFORM MAINTENANCE ALLOWANCE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the uniform maintenance allowance for enlisted personnel in the Hawaii national guard was established in 1967 to assist them with certain expenses.  Subsequently, under Act 197, Session Laws of Hawaii 2004, the legislature increased the tax exemption for enlisted personnel, which in effect, more than covered any anticipated costs with respect to uniform maintenance.  Additionally, the legislature finds that most modern military service uniforms are made of wash and wear fabric that no longer requires dry cleaning.  Consequently, considering the budget crisis faced by state government, the uniform maintenance allowance is not warranted at this time.
     The purpose of this Act is to repeal the uniform maintenance allowance for enlisted personnel.
     SECTION 2.  Section 121-41, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed.
     ["§121-41  Uniform maintenance allowance for enlisted personnel.  [(a)]  Enlisted personnel of the army or air national guard while participating in annual training or year-round training, when federal pay is authorized, or when ordered to state active duty in accordance with section 121-30, shall, except when actually called or ordered into the service of the United States by or under the authority of the President, receive a uniform maintenance allowance of $1.50 per day from the State.
     [(b)]  Enlisted personnel of the army or air national guard who receive a uniform maintenance allowance from the state department of defense, regardless of the source of the funds, may designate a financial institution account into which the department of accounting and general services is authorized to deposit the member's uniform maintenance allowance."]
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2112.
