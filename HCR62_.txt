HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON THE CORRELATION BETWEEN CHILDREN WHO ARE LATE-BORN AND THE HIGH SCHOOL DROP OUT RATE.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, research shows that the first five years of a child's life contain crucial physical, mental, and social developmental milestones that have life-long effects; and
 
     WHEREAS, late-born children, defined as those born after August 1, are younger when enrolling in kindergarten and then grouped with older children born in the same year; and
 
     WHEREAS, late-born children may not be as developed as their older counterparts when beginning kindergarten and, accordingly, may not perform as well in school as their older counterparts; and
 
     WHEREAS, lower academic performance may affect the self-esteem of late-born children, which in turn may lead to higher drop out rates for late-born children; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Education is requested to conduct research on the correlation between children who are late-born and the high school drop out rate; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the report on the research conducted include both the raw numbers and percentages of school drop outs by month born, quarter of the year born, gender, socio-economic status, ethnicity, special needs, and school complex area; and      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Education is requested to submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the Legislature no later than 20 days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Superintendent of Education.
