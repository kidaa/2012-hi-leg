RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO CONDUCT A STUDY ON THE EFFICACY OF COMBINING STATE GOVERNMENT HEALTH POLICY, PLANNING, AND PURCHASING IN A SINGLE AGENCY IN ORDER TO ADVANCE TRANSFORMATION OF HAWAII'S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO CARE.
 
 

     WHEREAS, the quality and cost of healthcare affects every resident of Hawaii, whether covered by public or private insurance or uninsured; and
 
     WHEREAS, the State of Hawaii spends nearly a quarter of its budget on healthcare purchasing and provides insurance for more than one-third of the population; and
 
     WHEREAS, new approaches to healthcare delivery, payment, and use of information technology can have a transformative effect on Hawaii's health and healthcare, resulting in more consistently high quality of care, reduced cost inflation, and a healthier population; and
 
     WHEREAS, the federal Affordable Care Act offers the State of Hawaii opportunities, guidance, and new requirements to transform our healthcare system; and
 
     WHEREAS, Governor Abercrombie has established a position of Healthcare Transformation Coordinator to lead the State's efforts to develop and implement a strategy to establish a healthcare system that is universal, of high quality, highly efficient, value-based, patient-centered, affordable, and accessible; and
 
     WHEREAS, transforming the state government's structure for healthcare policy, planning, and purchasing is part of a long-term plan for healthcare transformation and universal access to care that promises better quality and cost-effectiveness for beneficiaries of the State's programs as well as having a positive influence on the healthcare delivery and payment systems outside the state government's purview; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Governor's Office is requested to conduct a study of the efficacy of combining state government health policy, planning, and purchasing in a single agency in order to advance transformation of Hawaii's healthcare system and universal access to care; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the study shall identify the advantages and any disadvantages of such a change in departmental structure, enumerate the steps and timeline for making such a change, and provide an estimate of both the costs for implementation as well as potential savings and benefits; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Governor's Office shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the Legislature, including any proposed legislation, no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, to the President of the Senate, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to the Healthcare Transformation Coordinator, to the Director of Human Services, to the Director of Health, and to the Administrator of the Hawaii Employer-Union Health Benefits Trust Fund.
