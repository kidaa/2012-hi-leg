TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO SUBMIT A 5-YEAR ORGANIZATIONAL AND STRATEGIC PLAN.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, one of the largest state departments, the Department of Health (DOH) has displayed continual inconsistency within its structure and organization; and
 
     WHEREAS, since 2008, DOH has transferred 236 full-time employees and nearly $300 million within the department, moving positions and funds out to another sub-org or program ID one year, only to move them again the next year; and
 
     WHEREAS, these movements appear to be arbitrary and band-aid approaches to structural weaknesses in one of the state's largest departments; and
 
     WHEREAS, the current DOH Strategic Plan for the fiscal years spanning 2011-2014 titled, "Foundations for Healthy Generations", is a mere four pages in length and lacks detailed planning critical for strategic direction to meet a dynamic operating environment; and
 
     WHEREAS, the plan does not provide details for implementation, funding, staffing, operations, or anticipated national and environmental policy changes; and
 
     WHEREAS, a strategic plan for the DOH is long overdue, and would improve the delivery of critical health services provided by this large taxpayer-funded institution that uses a large percentage of the state budget, by examining in-depth the effectiveness and efficiency of departmental operations, both at the management and administrative levels, including the:
     (1)  Organization and management of the Department of Health, especially with regard to placement of programs and personnel; and
     (2)  Efficacy of fiscal operations, especially with respect to spending and accountability; and
 
     WHEREAS, such a strategic plan would ensure that the DOH fulfills its mission to administer programs that protect, preserve, care for, and improve the physical and mental health of all the people of the State; now, therefore
 
     BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Health shall prepare a five-year organizational, strategic plan which incorporates any or all previous retooling, restructuring, or strategic plans into one all-inclusive document; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the plan shall account for each year of the five year period beginning with the 2013 calendar year and shall include:
(1)  A detailed description of each agency of the department and program ID, including the program objective for each;
(2)  A detailed description of department-wide and agency specific goals of current reorganization efforts;
(3)  A cost-benefit analysis of any proposed personnel and/or funding transfer within the department;
(4)  A department-wide and agency specific expenditure plan including all means of financing for each of the five years;
(5)  Forecasted changes in the external and regulatory environment and the department's plan to respond to those changes, including funding, staffing and program modifications; and
(6)  Anticipated increases or decreases in demand for services, including anticipated impact to resource expenditures resulting from those changes and detailed forecasts in anticipated clientele numbers and corresponding funding needs by program ID; and 
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that DOH is requested to submit its comprehensive five year strategic plan no later than November 1, 2012; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a certified copy of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Department of Health.
