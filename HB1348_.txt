A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO EDUCATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's future depends on our youth, and the investments we make in our young people today will determine the course of our state in the years to come.  One of the greatest investments we can make is to provide our youth with the best possible opportunities in education.
     It has been proven that a proper scholastic environment–-one that is safe, secure, well-maintained, and clean--is a key contributor to a child's capacity to learn.
     However, the legislature finds that there is a continuing backlog of repair and maintenance projects for Hawaii's public schools. 
     The purpose of this Act is to provide resources for the repair, maintenance, and renovation of Hawaii's public schools.
     SECTION 2.  The director of finance is authorized to issue general obligation bonds in the sum of $392,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary is appropriated for fiscal year 2011-2012 for the purpose of the repair and maintenance of department of education school facilities.
     SECTION 3.  The appropriation made for the capital improvement projects authorized by this Act shall not lapse at the end of the fiscal biennium for which the appropriation is made; provided that all moneys from the appropriation unencumbered as of June 30, 2014, shall lapse as of that date.
     SECTION 4.  The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of education.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
