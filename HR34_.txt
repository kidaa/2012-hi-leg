HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
COMMENDING AND CONGRATULATING ROSE LEE FOR DEDICATED SERVICE TO HAWAII’S MILITARY COMMUNITY, AND THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, in describing the measure of success, President Barack Obama said:
 
     “That’s what building a body of work is all about.  It’s about the daily labor, the many individual acts, the choices large and small that add up over time, over a lifetime to a lasting legacy.  It’s about not being satisfied with the latest achievement, the latest gold star, because the one thing I know about a body of work is that it’s never finished.  It’s cumulative.  It depends and expands with each day you give your best.  You may have setbacks and you may have failures, but you’re not done.  You haven’t even started.”; and
 
     WHEREAS, no one has more clearly demonstrated the perseverance and dedication it takes to succeed than ROSE LEE; and
 
     WHEREAS, for nearly half a century, ROSE LEE would open her small tailor shop each day and utilize her impressive sewing skills to make service members look sharp in uniform; and
 
     WHEREAS, whether it be for generals or the ordinary private first class, ROSE LEE would do her best to make each uniform -- with all of the intricate patches, ranks, and insignias -- fit to perfection; and
 
     WHEREAS, as service members learned of her great skill, more and more of Hawaii’s military would seek out ROSE LEE to work on their uniforms; and
 
     WHEREAS, among the many dignitaries who specifically asked for ROSE LEE to work on their uniforms were:  United States Senator Daniel Inouye; former Army Chief of Staff and now United States Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric “Ric” Shinseki; and Lieutenant General Francis Wiercinski, head of the Army in the Pacific; and
 
     WHEREAS, ROSE LEE did not only help our military personnel -- she also made countless prom dresses, men’s dress shirts, and wedding dresses to Hawaii’s civilian community alike; and
 
     WHEREAS, working nonstop from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. each day for decades upon decades, ROSE LEE has epitomized dedication to her craft and to the thousands of citizens she has served; and
 
     WHEREAS, ROSE LEE’s commitment to excellence and skill has also been passed on to the new generation of tailors and seamstresses who have sought her guidance over the years; and
 
     WHEREAS, in September 2011, to the dismay of her faithful customers, ROSE LEE decided it was time to retire to spend more time with her husband, Henry, and her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, including Laura, Paul, Brent, Jenise, Brandon, Ava, Mia, Henry, Cheryl, Krissa, Mitchell, Emily, Lissa, Leslie, and Ivan; and
 
     WHEREAS, on February 21, 2012, the people of the State of Hawaii will recognize the “success” of ROSE LEE on the occasion of her retirement during the Floor Session of the House of Representatives of the Hawaii State Legislature; now, therefore,
 

     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, hereby commends and congratulates ROSE LEE for her faithful service to the people of the State of Hawaii, and extends to her its most sincere best wishes for continued joy, health, and happiness during her retirement years.
