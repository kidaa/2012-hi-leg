TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that many people with disabilities in this State rely on motorized wheelchairs to independently meet the daily demands of life, including grocery shopping, doctor appointments, and visiting family.  Many of these people have no one to call if their wheelchair breaks down.  On-call motorized wheelchair service, not unlike emergency roadside service provided by the city and county of Honolulu, would provide much needed support to the residents of this State who find themselves in a very vulnerable position.
SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for a grant-in-aid to the counties for the provision of on-call motorized wheelchair service and repair, and loaners or rentals while wheelchair repairs are being made; provided that no funds shall be made available to any county unless the county provides matching funds equal to the amount appropriated for the purposes of this Act.
The appropriation to each county shall be as follows:
     (1)  City and county of Honolulu       $          
     (2)  Hawaii county                     $          
     (3)  Kauai county                      $          
     (4)  Maui county                       $          
The sum appropriated shall be expended by the respective counties for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
