STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING A STUDY OF THE SOCIAL IMPACTS OF A SINGLE STAND-ALONE CASINO IN WAIKIKI.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the issue of legalized gambling in Hawaii has been studied and considered at least three times since statehood including in 1962, 1994, and 1997; and
 
     WHEREAS, there have been over one hundred fifty proposals in support of legalized gambling submitted to the Legislature within the past nearly three decades, including land-based casinos, shipboard casinos, pari-mutuel wagering facilities, and the lottery; and
 
     WHEREAS, since the economic downturn, the Legislature has proposed such legislation annually to generate revenue to maintain essential government services; and
 
     WHEREAS, the State has also been exploring the development of new visitor attractions and niche markets to improve the growth of the visitor industry and increase Hawaii's competitiveness; and
 
     WHEREAS, there are more than seventy countries with legalized gambling; and
 
     WHEREAS, there are only two states that prohibit all types of gambling, of which Hawaii is one; and
 
     WHEREAS, a single stand-alone casino in Waikiki has been identified as a form of gambling that may be considered; and
 
     WHEREAS, those opposed to legalized gambling argue that all forms of gaming are "immoral" and will lead to an increase in crime, addiction, and the breakdown of families and communities; and      WHEREAS, the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism prepared a report to the Nineteenth Legislature in response to Senate Resolution No. 282, S.D. 1, H.D. 2, Regular Session of 1996, noting that gaming will likely produce relatively modest economic and fiscal benefits, but that it is necessary to study further the larger, uncertain social costs of crime and pathological gambling to the host community in conjunction with economic and fiscal gains; and
 
     WHEREAS, to make a fully informed decision about a single stand-alone casino in Waikiki, the Legislature needs comprehensive and objective information about the social impact of these forms of legalized gambling in Hawaii; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism is requested to conduct a study on the social impacts of a single stand-alone casino in Waikiki; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Hawaii Tourism Authority, the Honolulu Police Department, the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, and the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau are requested to cooperate with the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism by providing access to information and assistance in facilitating surveys that may be deemed necessary; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism is requested to submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism; the Director of Commerce and Consumer  Affairs; the Director of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau; and the Chief of Police of the Honolulu Police Department.
