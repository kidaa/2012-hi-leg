TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES TO CONDUCT A STUDY ON ASSET LIMITS TO QUALIFY FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, public assistance programs currently limit eligibility to individuals and families with few or no assets to ensure public resources are provided to those most in need; and
 
     WHEREAS, however, asset limits can discourage savings and prevent families from making investments that can help them escape poverty and reliance on public assistance programs; and
 
     WHEREAS, while the Legislature could amend the law to raise the asset limit, such a change may affect all assistance programs administered by the Department of Human Services; and
 
     WHEREAS, a more prudent approach would be to study the potential effects of raising the asset limit; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Department of Human Services is requested to conduct a study on asset limits to qualify for public assistance; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the study is requested to include a review and evaluation of information on practices, policies, and trends regarding asset limits, and the applicability of asset limits to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program, Temporary Assistance to Other Needy Families Program, and the MedQuest Program; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Human Services consider the cost implications related to changing these asset limits; and      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Human Services is requested to submit a report of its findings and any proposed legislation, including recommendations for appropriate changes to asset limits, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Human Services.
