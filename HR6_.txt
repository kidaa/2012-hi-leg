     WHEREAS, article XI, section 1 of the Hawaii Constitution affirms the State's duty to conserve and protect Hawaii's natural beauty and all natural resources for the benefit of present and future generations; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii state law recognizes that "all indigenous species of aquatic life" are "integral parts of Hawaii's native ecosystems" and are natural resources of significant scientific, cultural and environmental value, and accordingly, in order to "insure the continued perpetuation of indigenous aquatic life" the Legislature charged the State with the duty to "take positive actions to enhance their prospects for survival"; and
 
     WHEREAS, the total economic value of Hawaii's coral reef ecosystems is an estimated $34,000,000,000 annually; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii's indigenous and endemic aquatic species are being devastated by collection for aquarium purposes, significantly altering reef wildlife assemblages and corresponding coral reef and marine ecosystem balance; and
 
     WHEREAS, the majority of aquarium-targeted aquatic life species are herbivores, providing the essential ecosystem service of protecting corals from being overgrown by algae; and
 
     WHEREAS, endemic species, occurring nowhere else in the world and contributing to Hawaii's natural legacy, are threatened with extinction by collection for aquarium purposes; and
 
     WHEREAS, the County of Maui has passed legislation to prevent further degradation of their reefs and aquatic life; and
 
     WHEREAS, despite measures, such as a collection prohibition along thirty-five per cent of the west Hawaii coastline, intended to mitigate aquarium trade related species depletion, scientific research proves that collection of reef fish for aquarium purposes continues to significantly diminish targeted populations, including endemic species, and important human food species like kole (goldring surgeonfish) and paku‘iku‘i (achilles tang); and
 
     WHEREAS, taking reef wildlife and disturbing reef ecosystems for decoration, entertainment, and display in corporate offices and private homes around the world is contrary to native Hawaiian values and cultural ideas, including the State of Hawaii motto, Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono, the life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness; and
 
     WHEREAS, article XII, section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution affirms protection of native Hawaiian rights customarily and traditionally exercised for subsistence cultural and religious purposes; and
 
     WHEREAS, a balanced marine ecosystem is important to the survival and sustainability of fishing grounds (koa) the ability to continue to fish and gather using customary and traditional methods and is a critically important element in perpetuating native Hawaiian customary and traditional practices; and
 
     WHEREAS, the County of Hawaii has passed a resolution that, in order to prevent further degradation of their reefs and aquatic life and to protect all of Hawaii's reefs and aquatic life, urges the Legislature to enact a law prohibiting the sale of aquatic life for aquarium purposes; and
 
     WHEREAS, in a cultural and environmentally driven tourism economy the continued protection of our reefs and its inhabitants enhances the overall cultural experience which brings millions of tourism dollars into the state coffers; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Council of the County of Kauai urges the Governor to ensure compliance with state laws intended to protect Hawaii's natural and cultural resources by using his constitutional authority as chief executive coupled with his duty to see that the State's laws are faithfully executed to issue a moratorium on the sale of aquatic life taken for aquarium purposes from state waters; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Council of the County of Kauai urges the Department of Land and Natural Resources and the Legislature to protect our reefs and its aquatic life and promote increasing reef fish population that will continue to enhance the overall experience of Hawaii's culture and natural resources and attract and sustain the tourist industry of our State by prohibiting the sale for aquarium purposes of aquatic life taken from state waters; now, therefore,
