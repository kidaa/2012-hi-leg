TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO OCEAN SAFETY.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that increased recreational and commercial activities in Hawaii's nearshore waters have led to safety concerns and, in some cases, tragic results.  According to the department of land and natural resources, there were at least four accidents involving swimmers and divers being struck by boats in 2011.  In December 2011, a man died after being struck by a boat in waters off of Hanakoo beach park on the island of Maui.
     Many nearshore areas statewide are popular attractions for multiple ocean activities.  The legislature finds that one such area is Kamaole beach on the island of Maui.  The amount of growth on Maui has resulted in an overabundance of ocean and beach goers and the legislature finds that there is a compelling need to provide safe and suitable areas for residents and visitors to enjoy the water.
     The legislature finds that installing safety features such as swim zone buoys to more clearly delineate areas reserved for differing uses will ensure greater ocean safety in highly populated areas of the State.
     The purpose of this Act is to improve ocean safety by appropriating funds for swim zone buoys at Kamaole beach.
     SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that eight swim zone buoys are needed at the following coordinates:
     (1)  Buoy 1:  N 20° 42.623, W 156° 26.836;
     (2)  Buoy 2:  N 20° 42.736, W 156° 26.863;
     (3)  Buoy 3:  N 20° 42.836, W 156° 26.888;
     (4)  Buoy 4:  N 20° 42.984, W 156° 26.912;
     (5)  Buoy 5:  N 20° 43.120, W 156° 26.934;
     (6)  Buoy 6:  N 20° 43.237, W 156° 26.962;
     (7)  Buoy 7:  N 20° 43.410, W 156° 27.019; and
     (8)  Buoy 8:  N 20° 43.498, W 156° 27.043.
     SECTION 3.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $500,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the installation of eight swim zone buoys at Kamaole beach at the coordinates specified in section 2 of this Act for the purpose of increasing the safety of ocean users.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of land and natural resources for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
