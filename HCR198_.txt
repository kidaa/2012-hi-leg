TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TASK FORCE TO DEVELOP AN INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE PLAN TO THE TSUNAMI DEBRIS GENERATED BY THE MARCH 2011 EARTHQUAKE IN JAPAN THAT MAY REACH HAWAII'S SHORES.
 
 

     WHEREAS, this body finds that Japan experienced an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 9.1 in March 2011, the fourth most powerful ever recorded; and
 
     WHEREAS, the earthquake generated a tsunami that dragged three million to four million tons of debris into the ocean after tearing up Japanese harbors and homes; and
 
     WHEREAS, scientists believe ocean currents are carrying some of the debris across the Pacific Ocean toward the United States and one to five percent of the one million to two million tons of debris still in the ocean may reach the shores of Hawaii, Alaska, Oregon, and Washington in the United States and British Columbia in Canada; and
 
     WHEREAS, the majority of the objects expected to be among the debris are from Japan's fishing industry, for example large buoys suspected to be from Japanese oyster farms that were found on the shores of Alaska in late 2011; and
 
     WHEREAS, debris that washes up on coral reefs or beaches could harm wildlife, such as endangered Hawaiian monk seals; and
 
     WHEREAS, the debris is largely dispersed over a wide area that makes it difficult to rely on satellite imagery to track the debris; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii must stand prepared to ensure prompt and effective action if the debris reaches the shores of Hawaii; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Director of State Civil Defense is requested to convene a task force to develop an international response plan to ensure prompt and effective action to address tsunami debris generated by the March 2011 earthquake in Japan if it reaches Hawaii's shores; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force include the Director of State Civil Defense, or the Director's designee, and a representative from:
 
     (1)  The military;
 
     (2)  The National Disaster Preparedness Training Center at the University of Hawaii;
 
     (3)  The Rotary Club;
 
     (4)  The Lions Club International;
 
     (5)  Kiwanis International;
 
     (6)  The Nature Conservancy;
 
     (7)  The National Audubon Society;
 
     (8)  The Sierra Club; and
 
     (9)  The Surfrider Foundation; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force is requested to address the following as part of the international response plan:
 
     (1)  Whether available information must be updated to include information on debris that may reach Hawaii's shores;
 
     (2)  Identify needs such as sirens, evacuation procedures, road closures, transportation of evacuees to safe areas, available emergency personnel, and emergency supplies, for various situations involving the tsunami debris;
 
     (3)  Coordination and execution by local and state authorities of emergency response plans and other activities in preparation for the arrival, collection, and disposal of the debris;
 
     (4)  Safeguards that must be put in place to prevent or minimize the harm to wildlife, such as the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, that may be caused by floating debris; and
 
     (5)  Any other relevant issues that may be important to ensuring prompt and effective action to avoid or mitigate the negative impacts of any debris that may reach Hawaii's shores; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that members of the task force shall not receive compensation for their service but shall be reimbursed for necessary expenses, including travel expenses, incurred in the performance of their duties; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force is requested to submit a report detailing the international response plan and any relevant findings and recommendations to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2014; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force be dissolved on June 30, 2014; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, the Director of State Civil Defense, the Director of the National Disaster Preparedness Training Center at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, the Rotary Club, the Lions Club International, Kiwanis International, The Nature Conservancy, the National Audubon Society, the Sierra Club, and the Surfrider Foundation.
