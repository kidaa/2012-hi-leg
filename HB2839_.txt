STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO BOTTLED WATER.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that it is in the public interest for residents of Hawaii to always have access to fresh water resources.  The legislature further finds that the bottling of Hawaii's fresh water for sale outside the State endangers the availability of this precious resource for future generations.
     The purpose of this Act is to reduce the likelihood of future conflicts over fresh water resources in Hawaii and ensure the future access to fresh water resources for all Hawaii residents by prohibiting the bottling of Hawaii's fresh water for sale outside the State.  
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 174, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§174-    Bottling of fresh water resources for sale; prohibition.  No person shall remove fresh water from any stream, spring, watercourse, well, aquifer, or other water source within the State, above or below ground, for the purposes of bottling and selling the fresh water outside the State.  This section shall not apply to desalinated seawater or the municipal use of fresh water."
     SECTION 3.  This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date.
     SECTION 4.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
