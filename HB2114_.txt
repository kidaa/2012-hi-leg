A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE HAWAII HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that health insurance exchanges established in the Patient and Protection Affordable Care Act of 2010 are intended to support consumers and their access to, and information regarding, quality, affordable health care. 
     The purpose of this Act is to clearly define the consumer in the health insurance exchange board, strengthen statewide consumer and business representation on the health insurance exchange board, address conflicts of interest on the health insurance exchange board by preventing health plans from serving on the board, and requiring the health insurance exchange to offer a basic health plan.
     SECTION 2.  Section 435H-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows:
     ""Consumer" means an enrollee in the state medicaid program, medicare program, or a person who receives health care benefits through the Hawaii health insurance exchange."
     SECTION 3.  Section 435H-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (g) to read as follows:
     "(g)  The connector shall make qualified plans, [and] qualified dental plans, and the basic health plan as defined in the federal act available to qualified individuals and qualified employers beginning with effective dates on or before January 1, 2014."
     SECTION 4.  Section 435H-4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:
     "(b)  The membership of the board shall reflect geographic statewide diversity, including representation from all islands, and the diverse interests of stakeholders including consumers, employers, [insurers,] and [dental benefit] providers[.]; provided that no insurers shall be appointed to the board.  The director of commerce and consumer affairs or the director's designee, the director of health or the director's designee, the director of human services or the director's designee, and the director of labor and industrial relations or the director's designee shall be ex-officio, voting members of the board."
     SECTION 5.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.      SECTION 6.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
