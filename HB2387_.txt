TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO NEW MARKETS TAX CREDITS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the business community, nonprofit organizations, and other entrepreneurs require a functional, service-oriented agency that is readily available to provide business counseling, financial backing, and general support to foster real community-based economic development for the various products and services demonstrating and embracing Hawaii's diversified economy.
     The Hawaii community-based economic development technical and financial assistance program in the department of business, economic development, and tourism, was established for this purpose.  The program was established by the legislature in Act 111, Session Laws of Hawaii 1990, and codified as chapter 210D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to provide financial assistance to community-based businesses and enterprises through low-interest loans and grants to qualifying applicants.
     There are various programs provided by the federal government, nonprofits, and foundations, and there are opportunities provided by public-private partnerships that further these goals.  These programs and partnerships can be used to provide a portion of the funding needed by economic development projects.  The project funding provided by Hawaii will be made more efficient and more effective if it is provided in the form most compatible with such programs and in the manner most suitable to optimize all sources of funding.  To achieve this, some modifications are necessary to the types of financial products offered by the community-based economic development program and the manner in which those products are provided along with an increase in the total amount that may be provided for an individual project and borrower.
     The purpose of this Act is to:
     (1)  Add the definition of "community development entity" to allow financing to be provided by Hawaii through a structure that facilitates the use of federal new markets tax credits;
     (2)  Expand the methods of delivering funding to a project by providing loans to capitalize a community development entity and to provide guarantees or other credit enhancements that will facilitate private lenders' participation in new markets tax credit financing; and
     (3)  Adjust loan maximums and establish guarantees or credit enhancements to reflect current available funding and facilitate monetization of existing project assets for purposes of new markets tax credit financing.
     SECTION 2.  Section 210D-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows:
     ""Community development entity" has the same meaning as in section 45D(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended."
     SECTION 3.  Section 210D-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:

     (3)  Establish the conditions, consistent with the purpose of this chapter, for the awarding of financial assistance;

   [(12)] (14)  Adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to implement this chapter."
     SECTION 4.  Section 210D-9, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§210D-9  Loans[; limitation and terms].  Loans made under this chapter shall be [for the purposes and in accordance with the terms specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) and shall be made only to applicants who meet the eligibility requirements specified therein.] limited to the following:

     [The loans shall be for an amount not to exceed $250,000 and for a term not to exceed ten years.]"

    [(4)] (5)  The commencement date for the repayment of the first installment on principal and interest of each loan may be deferred by the director of business, economic development, and tourism for a period not to exceed two years."
