HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING A STUDY ON THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF ESTABLISHING CERTIFICATION AND LICENSURE FEES TO SUPPORT CERTAIN DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES' PROGRAMS.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Department of Human Services has cut its budget by approximately $129,000,000 over the biennium with the Med-QUEST Division sustaining the greatest loss of $75,000,000 in state funds over the biennium; and
 
     WHEREAS, the need for services provided by the Department of Human Services has grown to unprecedented numbers due to the economic downturn, job losses, and wage and benefit reductions; and
 
     WHEREAS, at the close of fiscal year 2011, the average monthly Med-QUEST enrollment was at 272,218 persons, an increase of 1.3 percent over fiscal year 2010; and
 
     WHEREAS, one of the key indicators of the growing need for services provided by the Department of Human Services is the spike in enrollment in Med-QUEST programs over a five-month period at the end of fiscal year 2011, which reflected an increase of 4.3 percent; and
 
     WHEREAS, another alarming indicator of growing need and poverty is the increase in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which rose to 77,133 families, an increase of 15.3 percent compared to fiscal year 2010; and
 
     WHEREAS, to compensate for the budget shortfall of $75,000,000 in state funds over the biennium, the Department of Human Services will reduce medical services for non-disabled, non-pregnant adults in fiscal year 2012, and also reduce eligibility from 200 percent to 133 percent of the federal poverty level for non-disabled, non-pregnant adults; and
 
     WHEREAS, in addition, private contractors and child welfare service contracts suffered budget cuts of $38,000,000 and $5,800,000, respectively, for fiscal year 2011; and
 
     WHEREAS, other state governments charge fees for licensures and certifications as revenue-producing activities to offset their human services budgetary deficits; now, therefore,
 
                BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Human Services is requested to conduct a study to:
 
     (1)  Evaluate the benefits and feasibility of charging and collecting licensure and certification fees, including temporary and re-licensure and re-certification fees, for Department of Human Services' programs, including adult day care programs, such as adult day care and adult day hospitals, community care foster family homes, community case management agencies, and the nurse aide training program with certifications for qualified programs; and
 
     (2)  Determine which states charge fees for such licensure and certification and determine the best practices employed by those states; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Director of Human Services is requested to report its findings and recommendations, along with any suggested legislation, to the Legislature no later than 20 days before the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Human Services.
