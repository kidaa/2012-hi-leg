STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES TO EDUCATE OPERATORS OF ADULT RESIDENTIAL CARE HOMES AND COMMUNITY CARE FOSTER HOMES ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE INSURANCE FOR THEIR BUSINESS.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, community-based care is a major component of the long-term care system, the importance of which will increase as the population of Hawaii ages; and
 
     WHEREAS, at present, some homeowners, after using their homes for personal residential use only, choose to convert the homes into adult residential care homes or community care foster homes; and
 
     WHEREAS, while using their homes for personal residential use only, they purchase homeowners insurance, which generally covers property damage and certain liability exposure; and
 
     WHEREAS, after conversion to adult residential care homes or community care foster homes, some homeowners do not purchase business or commercial liability insurance; and
 
     WHEREAS, the homeowners believe that their homeowners' insurance will cover the business of operating an adult residential care home or community care foster home; and
 
     WHEREAS, this belief is a mistake; for example, homeowners' insurance does not cover business interruption; and
 
     WHEREAS, in essence, homeowners' insurance does not provide adequate or proper coverage for the business of operating an adult residential care home or community care foster home; and
 
     WHEREAS, better education is necessary to inform operators of adult residential care homes and community care foster homes of the advisability of carrying business or commercial liability insurance; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Department of Health and Department of Human Services are requested to implement a program to educate operators of adult residential care homes, community care foster homes, and other home-based care services about the appropriate insurance for their businesses; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the departments are requested to coordinate the program with the relevant trade organizations; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to Director of Health and Director of Human Services.
