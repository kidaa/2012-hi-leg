A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO AIR POLLUTION CONTROL.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Under the current department of health administrative rules, crematoriums constructed prior to March 20, 1972, are exempt from the air pollution control permit requirements required under chapter 342B, Hawaii Revised Statutes.  The legislature finds that it is in the interest of the public health to require all crematoriums operating within the State to be subject to the air pollution control permitting requirements.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 342B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§342B‑    Crematoriums.  All crematoriums of human remains operating within the State shall be subject to the permit requirements of this chapter; provided that owners or operators of crematoriums operating within the State without a permit which were constructed prior to March 20, 1972, shall submit permit applications to the department by December 31, 2012.  The department may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to effectuate the purposes of this section or to impose permit conditions to minimize ambient air quality impacts caused by crematoriums."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
