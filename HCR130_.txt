HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES TO SUPPORT AND INCLUDE THE PHILIPPINES IN THE VISA IMPROVEMENTS TO STIMULATE INTERNATIONAL TOURISM TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ACT.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, tourism is Hawaii's largest industry and a vital part of Hawaii's economy, providing revenue to the State and an abundance of tourism-related job opportunities; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Pacific region is an area that has the potential to bring new visitors to Hawaii and the rest of the United States because of emerging markets in Asia and other areas in the Pacific Rim; and
 
     WHEREAS, according to the 2010 United States Census, there are 197,497 Filipino Americans representing 14.5 percent of Hawaii's population; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2011, more than 9,000 Filipinos travelled to Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, reforming the visa process is a cost-effective way to make it easier for more international business and recreational visitors to travel to Hawaii and the rest of the United States; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Visa Improvements to Stimulate International Tourism to the United States of America Act (VISIT USA Act) would establish a five-year multiple entry visa for specified countries, but does not include the Philippines; and
 
     WHEREAS, including the Philippines in the VISIT USA Act would not only boost Hawaii's tourism industry, but also strengthen the State's strong ties to the Philippines; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Legislature urges the Congress of the United States to propose and support the inclusion of the Philippines in the VISIT USA Act; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Majority Leader, United States Senate; the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives; the members of Hawaii's congressional delegation; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services; and the Governor.
