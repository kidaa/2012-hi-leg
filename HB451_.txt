A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO TAXATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Chapter 235, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§235‑     New markets tax credit.  (a)  Section 45D (with respect to new markets tax credit) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be operative for the purposes of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in this section.
     (b)  Each taxpayer subject to the tax imposed by this chapter who holds a qualified equity investment on a credit allowance date of that investment, which occurs during the taxable year, may claim a credit under this section.  The amount of the credit shall be deductible from the taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed on a timely basis.
     (c)  The amount of the credit shall be equal to the applicable percentage of the amount paid to the qualified community development entity for the investment at its original issue.  The applicable percentage shall be calculated as provided in section 45D(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.
     (d)  For the purpose of this section, the determination of the following shall be made under the designated provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as follows:
     (1)  Credit allowance date shall be made under section 45D(a)(3);
     (2)  Qualified equity investment shall be made under section 45D(b), except that reference to "the Secretary" under section 45D(b)(1), shall be to the director;
     (3)  Qualified community development entity shall be made under section 45D(c);
     (4)  Qualified low-income community investment shall be made under section 45D(d);
     (5)  Low-income community shall be made under section 45D(e);
     (6)  Recapture of credit shall be made under section 45D(g), except that the tax for the taxable year shall be increased under section 45D(g)(1) only with respect to credits that were used to reduce state income tax; and
     (7)  Basis reduction shall be made under section 45D(h).
     (e)  The credit allowed under this section shall be deducted from the taxpayer's net income tax liability for the taxable year.  For the purpose of deducting this tax credit, net income tax liability means net income tax liability reduced by all other credits allowed to the taxpayer under this chapter.
     A tax credit under this section that exceeds the taxpayer's net income tax liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer's income tax liability in subsequent years until exhausted.  All claims for a tax credit under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to properly and timely claim the credit shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.  The credit may be claimed whether or not the taxpayer claims a federal credit under section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code.
     (f)  Section 469 (with respect to passive activity losses and credits limited) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be applied in claiming the credit under this section.
     (g)  The director may adopt rules under chapter 91 and prepare any forms necessary to carry out the purposes of this section."
