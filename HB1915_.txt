STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO MEDICAID.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the department of human services operates and has oversight of the State's medicaid program, a program that expends a significant amount of public funds annually.  Currently, the department of human services sets medicaid policy and changes within the program, without the input of the legislature.
     The purpose of this Act is to bring more transparency into the operations of the medicaid program in Hawaii, and to clarify the role of the legislature in setting medicaid program policies.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 346, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§346-     Medicaid program. (a)  The department shall notify the standing committees of the senate and the house of representatives that have primary jurisdiction for medicaid program oversight about any intended change to Hawaii's medicaid program.  The notification shall be made no later than sixty days prior to implementation; provided that for any proposed state plan amendment submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the notification shall be made prior to submission.  The notification shall include the full text and details of the intended change.
     (b)  The senate or house of representatives may hold hearings on any intended change proposed for the medicaid program or any proposed state plan amendment.
     (c)  The legislature, by law, may:
     (1)  Prohibit the department from making any intended change to the medicaid program or require the department to withdraw any proposed state plan amendment that has been submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; and
     (2)  Require the department to make changes to the medicaid program or submit a plan amendment to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
