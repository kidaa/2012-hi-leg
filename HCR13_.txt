STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU TO REVIEW ITS POLICIES REGARDING STREET AND ROAD WIDENING, WITH REGARD TO THEIR IMPACT ON PEDESTRIAN SAFETY.
 
 

     WHEREAS, in many Honolulu neighborhoods, older streets and roads are often narrow, which can impede the flow of traffic and raise safety issues; and
 
     WHEREAS, in an effort to improve traffic flow, the City and County of Honolulu may require a property setback in order to widen streets and roads; and
 
     WHEREAS, in neighborhoods with a high population of older residents, these seniors may be unable to cross the street in a timely fashion or safe manner, and wider streets in the residential areas in which they live may be more difficult for them to navigate; and
 
     WHEREAS, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2007 that Hawaii ranked No. 1 in pedestrian fatalities for people age 65 and over; and
 
     WHEREAS, of the 27 pedestrian fatalities in 2010, 10 were seniors; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the City and County of Honolulu is requested to review its policies regarding street and road widening, with regard to their impact on pedestrian safety; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the review include information on the impact of street and road widening on pedestrian safety in neighborhoods with significant senior populations; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the City and County of Honolulu report its findings and recommendations to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu and the Department of Planning and Permitting.
