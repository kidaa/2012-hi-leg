     (2)  Present the certificate of death to the physician or advanced practice registered nurse registered under chapter 457 last in attendance upon the deceased, or to the coroner's physician, who shall thereupon certify the cause of death to the physician's best knowledge and belief, or present the certificate of fetal death to the physician, advanced practice registered nurse registered under chapter 457, midwife, or other person in attendance at the fetal death, who shall certify the fetal death and such medical data pertaining thereto as can be furnished; provided that fetal deaths of less than twenty-four weeks or intentional terminations of pregnancy performed in accordance with section 453-16 may be certified by a nurse or other employee based upon the physician's records; and
