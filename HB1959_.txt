TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
MAKING AN APPROPRIATION FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, informally known as the "food stamp program," is a federal and state program to help low-income families buy the food that they need to stay healthy and be productive members of society.  In 2010, the federal government increased funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and amended the rules to allow more families to qualify for assistance.  Because unemployment checks caused many to gross more than the one hundred thirty per cent of the federal poverty limit threshold, the federal government increased the gross income limit to two hundred per cent of the federal poverty limit.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to respond to the United States Department of Agriculture mandate of July 1, 2010, and to maximize the number of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program beneficiaries.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $2,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 to carry out the purposes of this Act, including the hiring of necessary staff and increasing electronic systems capabilities to respond to the United States Department of Agriculture mandate of July 1, 2010, which raised the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program eligibility from one hundred thirty per cent of the federal poverty level to two hundred per cent of the federal poverty level.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of human services for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
