HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE HAWAII STADIUM AUTHORITY, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE HAWAII TOURISM AUTHORITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII, TO CONDUCT A STUDY REGARDING THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPROVING AND EXPANDING THE ALOHA STADIUM AND ITS GROUNDS.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Aloha Stadium hosts a variety of events, including University of Hawaii and high school sporting events, fairs, and other events that attract both residents and tourists; and
 
     WHEREAS, stadium improvements and expansion would encourage the development of revenue-generating attractions and accommodations in the area that could, in turn, finance the cost of maintaining and improving the stadium and grounds; and
 
     WHEREAS, development may include a small commercial and retail center near the stadium with restaurants, commercial shops, and other businesses; and
 
     WHEREAS, construction of a hotel would allow visiting sports teams and their fans, as well as persons visiting family members or conducting business in nearby areas or military bases, to stay in the stadium area instead of having to travel from other parts of the island; and
 
     WHEREAS, the development of a multi-family workforce rental housing district would allow people to take advantage of the transit-oriented development in the area; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Hawaii Stadium Authority, in consultation with the University of Hawaii and the Hawaii Tourism Authority, is requested to study the feasibility of improvements and expansions of the Aloha Stadium and grounds; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that renovations to the stadium and new commercial developments on stadium grounds are urged to be environmentally sustainable, whenever possible; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Hawaii Stadium Authority is requested to submit a report to the Legislature, no later than twenty days prior to the Regular Session of 2013, of the findings and recommendations, including any proposed recommendations, of the study; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism, President of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, Chairperson of the Hawaii Stadium Authority, and the President and the Chairperson of the Board of Regents of the University of Hawaii.
