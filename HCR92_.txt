RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES TO ADOPT THE VETERANS REMEMBERED FLAG.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, it is estimated that more than twenty million veterans, affiliated and unaffiliated with veterans' organizations, have served in the United States armed services; and
 
     WHEREAS, there are flags honoring all branches of the armed services, as well as flags for POWs and MIAs, but there is no official flag to honor military veterans and the service that they have provided to the nation; and
 
     WHEREAS, a flag to honor veterans would provide an enduring symbol of gratitude for the contributions that veterans have made to the nation; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Sonoma Veterans Memorial Park Association has designed the Veterans Remembered Flag, the symbolism of which pays respect to the history of the nation, all branches of the armed services, and those veterans who have served or died in service of the nation; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Veterans Remembered Flag has been recognized by sixteen states to date, as well as the United States Navy Memorial Foundation and the American Legion at four California state conventions; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the President and Congress of the United States are urged to adopt the Veterans Remembered Flag; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States, Majority Leader of the United States Senate, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, members of Hawaii's congressional delegation, and the President of the Sonoma Veterans Memorial Park Association.
