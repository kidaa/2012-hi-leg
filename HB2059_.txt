TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HIGHWAY SAFETY.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that air compression brake systems are designed primarily for commercial vehicles, such as school buses, garbage trucks, and race cars.  Modified air compression systems are used for assistance in stopping heavy weight and high speed vehicles and are unnecessary on passenger cars.
     The legislature further finds that when brakes with air compression systems are enabled, the brakes emit a loud noise when the build-up of air is released.  This noise emission has raised concerns within residential communities.
     The purpose of this Act is to prohibit the use of modified air compression braking systems on passenger cars.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 286, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§286-     Modified air compression brake systems; prohibited.  No passenger car operated in the State shall be equipped with a modified air compression braking system, commonly known as Jacob brakes.
     For the purpose of this section, the term passenger car has the same meaning as in section 286-2."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
