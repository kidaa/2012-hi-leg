TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO TAXATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that tax equity and fairness is paramount to the effective administration of the state tax system.  The 2005 tax review commission apparently concurred with this policy and recommended that the State provide relief to taxpayers by lowering the individual and corporate income tax rates and increasing the general excise tax to spread the tax burden to the tourism industry.
     The legislature also finds that modestly increasing the general excise tax and lowering individual and corporate income taxes will boost the State's shrinking economy by generating approximately $300,000,000 to assist small businesses and stimulate economic growth.  The net effect of these tax changes for most taxpayers would be negligible.
     The purpose of this Act is to provide equity to taxpayers and to boost the economy by increasing the general excise tax, lowering the individual and corporate income tax rates, increasing the food/excise tax credit and making it available to more taxpayers, and reinstating the hotel construction and remodeling tax credit to assist the construction and tourism industries.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 235, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§235-     Hotel construction and remodeling tax credit.  (a)  There shall be allowed to each taxpayer subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter and chapter 237D, an income tax credit that shall be deductible from the taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed; provided the tax credit is pre-certified by the department of taxation.
     The amount of the credit shall be four per cent of the construction or renovation costs incurred during the taxable year for each qualified hotel facility located in Hawaii, and shall not include the construction or renovation costs for which another credit was claimed under this chapter for the taxable year.  The total amount of tax credits allowed in any taxable year shall not exceed $4,000,000.
     In the case of a partnership, S corporation, estate, trust, association of apartment owners of a qualified hotel facility, time share owners association, or any developer of a time share project, the tax credit allowable is for construction or renovation costs incurred by the entity for the taxable year.  The cost upon which the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level.  Distribution and share of credit shall be determined pursuant to section 235-110.7(a).
     If a deduction is taken under section 179 (with respect to election to expense depreciable business assets) of the Internal Revenue Code, no tax credit shall be allowed for that portion of the construction or renovation cost for which the deduction is taken.
     The basis of eligible property for depreciation or accelerated cost recovery system purposes for state income taxes shall be reduced by the amount of credit allowable and claimed.  In the alternative, the taxpayer shall treat the amount of the credit allowable and claimed as a taxable income item for the taxable year in which it is properly recognized under the method of accounting used to compute taxable income.
     (b)  The credit allowed under this section shall be claimed against the net income tax liability for the taxable year.
     (c)  If the tax credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of credit over liability shall be refunded to the taxpayer; provided that no refunds or payment on account of the tax credits allowed by this section shall be made for amounts less than $1.  All claims for a tax credit under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.
     (d)  The director of taxation shall prepare any forms that may be necessary to claim a credit under this section.  The director may also require the taxpayer to furnish information to ascertain the validity of the claim for credit made under this section and may adopt rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91.
     (e)  The tax credit allowed under this section shall take effect on July 1, 2011, and shall not be available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013.
     (f)  To qualify for the income tax credit, the taxpayer shall be in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and county statutes, rules, and regulations and shall be pre-certified with respect to the tax credit by the department pursuant to rules adopted in accordance with chapter 91.
     (g)  As used in this section:
     "Construction or renovation cost" means any costs incurred after July 1, 2011, for plans, design, construction, and equipment related to new construction, alterations, or modifications to a qualified hotel facility.
     "Net income tax liability" means income tax liability reduced by all other credits allowed under this chapter.
     "Qualified hotel facility" means a hotel or hotel-condominium as defined in section 486K-1, and includes a time share facility or project.
     "Taxpayer" means a taxpayer under this chapter, and includes:
     (1)  Association of apartment owners; or
     (2)  Time share owners association."
     SECTION 3.  Chapter 237, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§237-     Imposition of additional tax.  (a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) there shall be levied, assessed, and collected as provided in this section on all gross proceeds and gross income taxable under this chapter, an additional of one-half of one per cent on the general excise tax imposed under this chapter.  The increase in the tax shall be imposed on the gross proceeds or gross income of all written contracts that require the passing-on of the tax imposed under this chapter; provided that if the gross proceeds or gross income are received as payments beginning in the taxable year in which the increase becomes effective, on contracts entered into before June 30 of the year prior to the taxable year in which the taxes become effective, and the written contracts do not provide for the passing on of increased rates of taxes, the increase shall not be imposed on the gross proceeds or gross income covered under the written contracts.  The increase shall be imposed on the gross proceeds or gross income from all contracts entered into on or after June 30 of the year prior to the taxable year in which the taxes become effective, regardless of whether the contract allows for the passing on of any tax or any tax increase.
     (b)  The increase shall not apply to:
     (1)  The gross income or gross proceeds taxable under this chapter at the one-half per cent tax rate;
     (2)  The gross income or gross proceeds taxable under this chapter at the 0.15 per cent tax rate; or
     (3)  Transactions, amounts, persons, gross income, or gross proceeds exempt from tax under this chapter.
     (c)  The director of taxation shall revise the general excise tax forms to accommodate the tax increase under this section.
     (d)  The penalties provided by section 231-39 for failure to file a tax return shall apply to the tax increase under this section.
     (e)  All taxpayers who file on a fiscal year basis whose fiscal year ends after December 31 of the year prior to the taxable year in which the taxes become effective, shall file a short period annual return for the period preceding January 1 of the taxable year in which the taxes become effective.  Each fiscal year taxpayer shall also file a short period annual return for the period starting on January 1 of the taxable year in which the taxes become effective, and ending before January 1 of the following year."
     SECTION 4.  Section 235-51, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (a), (b), and (c) to read as follows:
     "(a)  There is hereby imposed on the taxable income of (1) every taxpayer who files a joint return under section 235-93; and (2) every surviving spouse a tax determined in accordance with the following table:
