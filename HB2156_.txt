TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO PUBLIC LAND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Act 55, Session Laws of Hawaii 2011, now codified as chapter 171C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, created a process to use public land purporting to be for the economic, environmental, and social benefit for the people of Hawaii.  It established the public land development corporation to be the development arm of the department of land and natural resources, to administer an appropriate and culturally-sensitive public land development program to help develop recreational and leisure centers for persons, and create revenue-generating opportunities to offset regulatory functions of the department of land and natural resources.
     The legislature finds that the powers granted to the public land development corporation go beyond what is necessary and may threaten the commitments that the State and its people have made to protect native Hawaiian traditional customary rights and the natural and cultural resources that make Hawaii unique.  Chapter 171C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, does not ensure an appropriate and culturally-sensitive public land development program.  The legislature finds that the exemptions are overly broad, remove important planning and management tools, increase the likelihood of unprecedented development of the State's public and private lands, including a handful of rural community strongholds where native Hawaiian beliefs, values, traditions, and customs continue to be honored and practiced.
     The purpose of this Act is to repeal chapter 171C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and encourage the utilization and improvement of the existing system in order to use public land for the economic, environmental, and social benefit for the State.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 171C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
