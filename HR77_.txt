URGING HAWAII PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY TO ADOPT RULES TO PROHIBIT SMOKING IN ALL FEDERAL AND STATE PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS IN THE STATE.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the lead federal agency for comprehensive tobacco control, cites tobacco use as the single most preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States; and
 
     WHEREAS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each year, an estimated 443,000 people die prematurely from smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke, and another 8,600,000 people live with a serious illness caused by smoking; and
 
     WHEREAS, in response to the risks posed to nonsmokers by secondhand smoke, indoor smoking bans are being adopted nationwide; and
 
     WHEREAS, in a July 17, 2009, memorandum, recognizing that secondhand smoke can migrate between units in multifamily housing, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development encouraged public housing authorities to implement non-smoking policies in some or all of their public housing units; and
 
     WHEREAS, according to the Smoke-Free Environmental Law Project of the Center for Social Gerontology, an anti-smoking group funded by the Michigan Department of Health, there are at least 221 public housing authorities and housing commissions across the country that have implemented non-smoking policies in public housing projects, including authorities in Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, New York, and Texas; and
 
     WHEREAS, making public housing projects in the State smoke-free will lessen fire hazards, decrease cleaning costs, enhance the upkeep of public housing units, and support the health and well-being of public housing tenants; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that Hawaii Public Housing Authority is urged to adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), to prohibit smoking in all federal housing projects, as defined in section 356D-1, HRS, and state low-income housing projects as defined in section 356D-51, HRS, respectively, in the State; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Hawaii Public Housing Authority is requested to complete the process of adopting and publishing its rules no later than July 1, 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Hawaii Public Housing Authority is requested to submit to the Legislature no later than 20 days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013, a report of its progress in adopting rules that prohibit smoking in all federal and state public housing projects in the State; and
