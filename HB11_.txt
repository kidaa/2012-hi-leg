     (2)  The formative and summative assessment of a student's academic, physical, social, and emotional abilities,
provided that, beginning with the 2010-2011 school year, the department shall use successful assessment tools and protocols for determining a student's initial placement and for decision making about a student's movement between tiers and into grade one.  Junior kindergarten students may graduate directly to grade one when promotion is based on appropriate assessments and other progress data collected over time.
     (c)  [Beginning with the 2004-2005 school year, a child who will be at least five years of age on or before December 31 of the school year may attend a public school kindergarten.]  Beginning with the [2006-2007] 2012-2013 school year, a child who is not attending a private school or kindergarten who will [be at least] have arrived at the age of five years of age on or before August 1 of the school year [may] shall attend a public school kindergarten.  Beginning with the [2006-2007] 2012-2013 school year, a child who will be at least five years of age after August 1 and before January 1 of the school year may attend a public school junior kindergarten.  Beginning with the 2013-2014 school year, a child who will be at least five years of age on the first day of instruction may attend a public school kindergarten.

     SECTION 2.  Section 302A-1132, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "[§302A-1132]  Attendance compulsory; exceptions.  (a)  Unless excluded from school or excepted from attendance, all children who will have arrived at the age of at least [six] five years, and who will not have arrived at the age of eighteen years[,] on or before August 1 of any school year by January 1 of any school year, shall attend either a public or private school for, and during, the school year, and any parent, guardian, or other person having the responsibility for, or care of, a child whose attendance at school is obligatory shall send the child to either a public or private school.  Attendance at a public or private school shall not be compulsory in the following cases:
     (1)  Where the child is physically or mentally unable to attend school (deafness and blindness excepted), of which fact the certificate of a duly licensed physician shall be sufficient evidence;
     (2)  Where the child, who has reached the fifteenth anniversary of birth, is suitably employed and has been excused from school attendance by the superintendent or the superintendent's authorized representative, or by a family court judge;
     (3)  Where, upon investigation by the family court, it has been shown that for any other reason the child may properly remain away from school;

     (6)  Where:
         (A)  The child has attained the age of sixteen years;
         (B)  The principal has determined that:
              (i)  The child has engaged in behavior which is disruptive to other students, teachers, or staff; or
             (ii)  The child's non-attendance is chronic and has become a significant factor that hinders the child's learning; and
         (C)  The principal of the child's school, and the child's teacher or counselor, in consultation with the child and the child's parent, guardian, or other adult having legal responsibility for or care of the child, develops an alternative educational plan for the child.  The alternative educational plan shall include a process that shall permit the child to resume school.
          The principal of the child's school shall file the plan made pursuant to subparagraph (C) with the child's school record.  If the adult having legal responsibility for or care of the child disagrees with the plan, then the adult shall be responsible for obtaining appropriate educational services for the child."
