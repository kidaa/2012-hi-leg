TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the proper oversight of development plays an important role in balancing coastal areas with preservation and commercial or residential development.  However, due to the rise of inflation, the cost of construction disqualifies most projects from special management area minor permits.  Increasing the valuation for minor permits, while requiring no adverse impacts to the environment, is vital to maintaining a balance between the two competing interests.
     The purpose of this Act is to increase the threshold for special management area minor permits and special management area use permits.
     SECTION 2.  Section 205A-22, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending the definitions of "special management area minor permit" and "special management area use permit" to read as follows:
     ""Special management area minor permit" means an action by the authority authorizing development the valuation of which is not in excess of [$125,000] $250,000 and which has no substantial adverse environmental or ecological effect, taking into account potential cumulative effects.
     "Special management area use permit" means an action by the authority authorizing development the valuation of which exceeds [$125,000] $250,000 or which may have a substantial adverse environmental or ecological effect, taking into account potential cumulative effects."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
