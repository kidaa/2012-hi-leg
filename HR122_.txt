     WHEREAS, Medicaid and Medicare enrollees are a particularly vulnerable population; and
    
     WHEREAS, Medicaid and Medicare enrollees have high healthcare expenditures, receive fragmented care, have multiple healthcare related identification cards, and may be unsure of who to call for help; and
 
WHEREAS, providers who serve Medicaid and Medicare recipients must submit both Medicaid and Medicare claims and navigate two separate prior authorization, coverage, and other administrative processes; and
 
WHEREAS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proffered the opportunity for demonstrations to integrate primary, acute, behavioral health, and long-term care services; and
 
WHEREAS, the Department of Human Services already has Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved QUEST Expanded Access Medicaid managed care health plans that include Centers-approved dual eligible special needs plans; and
 
WHEREAS, future QUEST Expanded Access health plans with dual eligible special needs plans would be expected to join the integration demonstration; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Department of Human Services is requested to implement a demonstration project to integrate care for individuals enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare in order to improve patient-centeredness and quality of care, help reduce provider administrative burden, and generate savings to the state and federal governments; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Human Services is requested to optimize participation in the integration demonstration while preserving consumer choice; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Director of Human Services is requested to submit an informative status report to the Legislature no later than twenty days before the convening of the Regular Session of 2013, and a subsequent detailed report of findings, challenges, and recommendations, including necessary proposed legislation, no later than twenty days before the convening of the Regular Session of 2014; and
