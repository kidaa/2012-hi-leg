RELATING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Chapter 304A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:

     For fiscal year 2012-2013, the amount of general fund budget appropriations shall be based on student enrollment data from fiscal year 2011-2012."
     SECTION 2.  Section 304A-2101, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is repealed.
     ["[§304A-2101]  General fund budget appropriations; formulation.  (a)  The general fund budget appropriations for the university shall be an amount not less than three times and not greater than five times the amount of regular tuition and related fee revenues estimated for that fiscal year.
     (b)  Any general fund budget appropriation for the university for operating purposes for any fiscal year shall include the consideration of:
     (1)  The fiscal condition of the State;
     (2)  Enrollment;
     (3)  Access to educational opportunity;
     (4)  The mix of resident and nonresident students; and
     (5)  Community service and noninstruction programs.
     (c)  No revenue received by the university pursuant to the University of Hawaii tuition and fees special fund established under section [304A-2153] may be used by the governor or the director of finance as a justification for reducing any budget request or allotment to the university unless the university requests such a reduction."]
     SECTION 3.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the University of Hawaii to develop the funding model established under this Act and to upgrade their computer systems technology to implement the funding model.
