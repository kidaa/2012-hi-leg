A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO KIKALA-KEOKEA.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the displaced residents of Kalapana on the island of Hawaii, who were allowed to enter into long-term leases of the Kikala-Keokea homestead area pursuant to Act 314, Session Laws of Hawaii 1991, as amended, have been unable to construct dwellings on their lots as required by their leases, due to the lack of infrastructure in the area.  The legislature further finds that a ten-year extension of time during which the lessees may construct their dwellings would further the intent and purposes of Act 314, Session Laws of Hawaii 1991.
     SECTION 2.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the lessees of the Kikala-Keokea homestead area whose leases were authorized by Act 314, Session Laws of 1991, as amended, shall be allowed an additional period of ten years within which to construct dwellings as required by their leases, commencing upon the effective date of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
