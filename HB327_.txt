     (b)  Procurements of greater than $50,000 for construction under subsection (a) shall require security by a performance bond delivered to the purchasing agency that is:
     (1)  In a form prescribed by the rules of the policy board;
     (2)  Executed by a surety company authorized to do business in this State; and
     (3)  In an amount equal to one hundred per cent of the price specified in the contract,
or shall otherwise be secured by a performance bond in a manner satisfactory to the purchasing agency.
     (c)  Procurements of $25,000 to less than $100,000 shall be made in accordance with small purchase procedures; provided that small purchase procurements through an electronic system shall be required after the policy board has adopted rules for electronic procurement and provided training to the affected agency.
     (d)  Construction procurements of less than $50,000 to contract for drilling work and soil testing shall be made by competitive sealed bid; provided that the bid request shall be advertised to the public on the department's website; and provided further that the bid for drilling and soil testing shall be separate from a bid for the engineering work on the same project."
