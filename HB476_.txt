TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO CLEAN ENERGY BONDS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

PART I
     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the initial capital investment required by property owners to install renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements on residential and commercial properties is a significant barrier to reaching the State's clean energy targets.  Increased activity in residential and commercial projects is essential for the State to reach energy efficiency and clean energy goals.  Employing innovative financing to remove known barriers and stimulate enterprise in the clean energy sector is beneficial to the public.
     A Hawaii clean energy bond is a federal taxable, state tax-exempt, revenue bond to fund property assessed clean energy that is in the public interest.  The bond proceeds will be deposited into the clean energy bond loan revolving fund under the direction of the department of business, economic development, and tourism, which will make loans to commercial and residential property owners for energy efficiency improvements and small renewable energy systems.  The loans will be repaid through a special assessment of real property taxes on the borrower's property by the participating counties and remitted to the department under cooperative agreements.  The liability to repay the bonds is attached to the borrower's property, rather than to the borrower.
     Assisting renewable energy projects and investments in Hawaii can provide jobs, as well as long-term energy, environmental, and economic benefits.  Moreover, this Act is compatible with the goals and objectives of the Hawaii clean energy initiative.
     The legislature finds that the Hawaii clean energy bond loan program:
     (1)  Supports energy efficiency and renewable energy projects for residential and commercial structures;
     (2)  Provides another source of financing energy projects;
     (3)  Fosters energy savings;
     (4)  Stimulates job growth; and
     (5)  Is in the public interest and for the public health, safety, and general welfare of the State.
     The purpose of this Act is to establish a Hawaii clean energy bond loan program.
PART II

     (e)  Loan repayment.  Loans are repaid through a special assessment on real property tax bills.  The liability to repay the loan is attached to the property as an assessment on real property.  The participating county in which the assessed property is located is responsible for repayment to the State, but shall not be held liable in the event of default on said loans.  Loans for amounts over $5,000 may be repaid over a period of ten to twenty years, at the program administrator's discretion.  The length of time allowed for the property owner to repay the assessment shall not exceed the life expectancy of the systems or improvements.  Where multiple systems or improvements have been installed, the length of time for the property owner to repay the loan shall not exceed the average lifetime of all projects, weighted by cost.  Projects valued at $100,000 or more shall require approval by the department.  A loan pursuant to this Act shall not exceed $250,000.
     (f)  Loan re-application.  If a loan application is denied, the applicant may re-apply for the denied loan only if the problems that were grounds for denial under the preceding loan application have been remedied.
PART IV
     SECTION 8.  The director of finance is authorized to issue revenue bonds in the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary is appropriated for fiscal year 2011-2012 for deposit into the Hawaii clean energy bond loan revolving fund.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of business, economic development, and tourism for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 9.  This Act does not in any way prohibit or limit the counties' authority to institute a similar financing program for and within their respective county, independent of State partnership or involvement.
     SECTION 10.  If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the Act, which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable.

     (c)  Loan application review process.  The administrator, or in the case of projects valued at $100,000 or more, the department, shall accept the loan application so long as it is complete and complies with the loan application prerequisites and application process of this part.  If the loan application is accepted, the loan application reviewer shall notify the applicant of acceptance in writing within thirty days.  If the loan application does not meet the requirements of this part, the loan application reviewer shall provide the applicant with a written report of the reasons why the loan application is incomplete not more than thirty days from the submission of the loan application.  The loan application shall be approved or denied not more than ninety days from the date of acceptance, and the loan applicant shall be informed of the action in writing not more than thirty days from the day the action is taken on the loan application.
     (d)  Loan disbursement.  Once a loan is approved, the loan applicant will have thirty days upon receipt of the acceptance to either agree or reject the terms of the loan.  If the loan applicant agrees to the terms of the loan then the financial institution handling the applicable loan program funds will disburse the appropriate amount to the businesses hired to perform contractually agreed upon services.
     (e)  Loan repayment.  Loans are repaid through a special assessment on real property tax bills.  The liability to repay the loan is attached to the property as an assessment on real property.  The participating county in which the assessed property is located is responsible for repayment to the State, but shall not be held liable in the event of default on said loans.  Loans for amounts over $5,000 may be repaid over a period of ten to twenty years, at the program administrator's discretion.  The length of time allowed for the property owner to repay the assessment shall not exceed the life expectancy of the systems or improvements.  Where multiple systems or improvements have been installed, the length of time for the property owner to repay the loan shall not exceed the average lifetime of all projects, weighted by cost.  Projects valued at $100,000 or more shall require approval by the department.  A loan pursuant to this Act shall not exceed $250,000.
     (f)  Loan re-application.  If a loan application is denied, the applicant may re-apply for the denied loan only if the problems that were grounds for denial under the preceding loan application have been remedied.
PART IV
     SECTION 8.  The director of finance is authorized to issue revenue bonds in the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary is appropriated for fiscal year 2011-2012 for deposit into the Hawaii clean energy bond loan revolving fund.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of business, economic development, and tourism for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 9.  This Act does not in any way prohibit or limit the counties' authority to institute a similar financing program for and within their respective county, independent of State partnership or involvement.
     SECTION 10.  If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the Act, which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable.
     SECTION 11.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011; provided that part III shall be repealed upon the adoption of administrative rules in accordance with chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by the department of business, economic development, and tourism to effectuate part II of this Act.
