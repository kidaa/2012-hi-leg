HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THAT DEVELOPERS AND COUNTY PLANNING DEPARTMENTS ENCOURAGE SMALLER AND CHEAPER HOUSING.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, Hawaii's median rent of $1,291 in 2010 made it the most expensive of the 50 states; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2011, 41 per cent of Hawaii residents were paying more than the recommended 30 per cent of their income on housing for rent and mortgages; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii's limited availability of habitable land and high number of unoccupied rental units combine to drive up the price of housing for local residents; and
 
                WHEREAS, between 1980 and 2000, Hawaii’s housing stock rose from 1.8 percent seasonal units ranking it 35th in the nation to 5.6 percent of its housing stock reserved for seasonal or occasional use in 2000, ranking it 10th highest in the U.S.; and
 
     WHEREAS, the 2011 Hawaii Housing Planning Study prepared for the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation estimates that as many as 50,000 new rental units will be needed between 2012 and 2016 to keep up with new demand created by changing demographic and economic conditions; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii's median housing value of $525,400 in 2010 made it the most expensive residential real estate market in the country; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii is among the bottom 4 states in home-ownership at 58 per cent; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that Hawaii developers are urged to build more affordable housing by building small homes of 1000 square feet or less and small condominium units of 500 square feet or less in order to increase the state's stocks of affordable housing; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the planning departments of Hawaii County, Kauai County, Maui County and the City and County of Honolulu are urged to make the permitting process more amenable to the construction of small and affordable home and condominium units; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor of the State of Hawaii, the Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu, the Mayor of the County of Maui, the Mayor of the County of Kauai, the Mayor of the County of Hawaii, the General Contractors Association of Hawaii, and the Building Industry Association of Hawaii.
