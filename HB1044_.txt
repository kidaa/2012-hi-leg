     (1)  Posting on the State of Hawaii, department of budget and finance internet website;
     (2)  Publication in a daily or weekly publication of statewide circulation; or
     (3)  Any other method the director of finance deems effective for publicizing the notice."
     SECTION 3.  Section 42F‑107, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "[[]§42F‑107[]]  Grants; release by the governor.  If a grant awarded by the legislature pursuant to this chapter is not allocated or released by the governor within ninety days of the effective date of the legislation awarding the grant, the governor or the director of finance shall notify[,in the manner prescribed in section 1-28.5,] the recipient of the unreleased grant on the status of whether the grant is still pending or will not be released.  The governor or the director of finance shall provide the notice once every quarterly allotment period (as the periods are defined in section 37‑32), beginning on the ninety‑first day after the effective date of the legislation awarding the grant and until a final determination is made on the status of the grant.  Notwithstanding the requirements of section 1‑28.5, the notice may be given by using one or more of the following methods:
     (1)  Posting on the State of Hawaii, office of the governor or the department of budget and finance internet website;
     (2)  Publication in a daily or weekly publication of statewide circulation; or
