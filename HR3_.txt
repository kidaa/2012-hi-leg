STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TO ESTABLISH A HAWAII STATE AIRPORT AUTHORITY TASK FORCE TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A HAWAII STATE AIRPORT AUTHORITY.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, Hawaii is an island state that depends heavily upon its harbors and airports for the movement of cargo and persons between islands and to and from the rest of the world; and
 
     WHEREAS, with tourism as one of the prime industries of the state, Hawaii's economic sustainability depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of its airport system; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Department of Transportation is responsible for the planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of state facilities in all modes of transportation, including air, water, and land; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Department of Transportation currently provides, operates, and maintains eleven commercial-service airports and four general-aviation airports, with four of the five major airports serving domestic and international carriers; and
 
     WHEREAS, although Hawaii's air transportation planning, management, and development functions, as they relate to the airports owned or controlled by the State, are currently under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation's Airports Division, other agencies, including the Office of Hawaiian Affairs concerning ceded-lands issues, also play a role in developing, managing, and maintaining a safe and efficient global air-transportation system; and
 
     WHEREAS, a multi-jurisdictional and multi-agency situation with regard to planning and development of airport facilities may result in inefficiencies and conflicts over resources and uses that are difficult to resolve between agencies and may lead to conflicting plans of action among the different agencies to implement differing goals; and
 
     WHEREAS, the economic well-being of the state depends, in part, on the efficient use of its air-transportation resources, which will enhance and complement efforts to revitalize Hawaii's economy, and coordinated planning and development of air transportation within the state would be implemented more effectively by a single entity having overall consolidated jurisdiction; and
 
     WHEREAS, the establishment of a Hawaii State Airport Authority may have advantages that include providing an appropriate forum for all affected interests; increasing efficiency in land-utilization and related lease processes; streamlining administrative processes; making possible more responsive planning; increasing financial flexibility; and increasing responsiveness to customer needs and economic demands; and
 
     WHEREAS, the establishment of a Hawaii State Airport Authority may also assist the State in achieving important statewide objectives, including increased security for the state; improved administrative efficiency of Hawaii's airports system; and improved coordination of environmental issues affecting the State's airports, particularly relating to alien invasive species; and
 
     WHEREAS, the rational allocation and administration of scarce and increasingly valuable airport resources in the state through the establishment of a Hawaii State Airport Authority may be vital to the well-being of the people and economy of the State; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Department of Transportation is requested to establish the Hawaii State Airport Authority Task Force (Task Force) to determine the feasibility of establishing a Hawaii State Airport Authority; and
