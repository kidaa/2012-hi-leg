BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that protecting Hawaii's natural resources is essential to the public interest, particularly during these trying economic times.  People are faced not only with tough financial circumstances, but must also address obesity and other health problems that are commonplace throughout the nation.  Conserving open spaces such as parks and trails promotes the physical and emotional health and well-being of the people of this State.  People can find emotional solace in outdoor activities, such as hiking and family or group gatherings.  Moreover, anyone in this State, regardless of age or income, is able to enjoy and use the State's parks and trails at no cost.  The legislature further finds that parks and trails are an integral part of the State's relaxed, natural lifestyle.  The legislature also finds that parks and trails should be protected to ensure that these open spaces are available for future generations to enjoy.
     The purpose of this Act is to propose an amendment to article XI of the Hawaii constitution to require that .001 per cent of general excise tax revenues be allocated to the special land and development fund for the Hawaii statewide trail and access program and the state parks special fund.
     SECTION 2.  Article XI of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii is amended by adding a new section to read as follows:
"PARKS AND TRAILS
     Section    .  There shall be allocated .001 percent of the general excise tax revenues of the State to the special land and development fund for the Hawaii statewide trail and access program and the state parks special fund.  The money dedicated under this section shall be appropriated by law and shall be not diverted for any other purposes at any time."
     SECTION 3.  The question to be printed on the ballot shall be as follows:
"Shall .001 percent of the general excise tax revenues be allocated to the special land and development fund for the Hawaii statewide trail and access program and the state parks special fund?"
     SECTION 4.  New constitutional material is underscored.
     SECTION 5.  This amendment shall take effect upon compliance with article XVII, section 3, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii.
