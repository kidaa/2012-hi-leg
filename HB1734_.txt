TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE HOMELESS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that despite efforts by government and nonprofit organizations to provide overnight shelters for homeless persons, many homeless persons do not sleep at the overnight shelters because of mental illness, drug addiction, an inability to conform to shelter rules, or other reasons.  As a result, a large number of homeless persons can be found sleeping in public parks, on sidewalks, and similar areas, raising concerns not only for health and safety issues but also for the viability of the State's visitor industry.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to establish a safe haven program to provide overnight shelters for homeless persons in designated surplus or available open or vacant locations owned by the State.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 to establish safe havens for homeless persons in surplus or available open or vacant locations owned by the State; provided that:
     (1)  The funds shall be used to establish safe haven facilities, which shall include providing:
         (A)  Pavilions with open walls and overhead protection;
         (B)  Showers and toilets;
         (C)  Potable water;
         (D)  Coin-operated clothes washing machines and drying machines;
         (E)  Lockers;
         (F)  Security personnel; and
         (G)  Maintenance services for the safe haven sites;
     (2)  Camping at safe haven sites shall be permitted only at night; and
     (3)  Each homeless person shall be permitted to have a limited amount of possessions, as determined by the department of human services, and a maximum of one pet.
By no later than December 31, 2012, the department of human services shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 for the purposes of implementing this Act.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of human services for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  The department of human services shall submit a preliminary report to the legislature documenting the status of the safe haven program no less than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular sessions of 2013 and 2014, and a final report to the legislature summarizing the safe haven program, results achieved, actual expenditures, and recommended legislation, if any, no less than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2015.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012, and shall be repealed on June 30, 2015.
