REQUESTING THE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO REQUIRE EACH SCHOOL COMMUNITY COUNCIL TO REVIEW ITS SCHOOL'S ATTENDANCE POLICY, CREATE BENCHMARKS TO IMPROVE ATTENDANCE, AND DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO MEET THOSE BENCHMARKS.
 
 

     WHEREAS, student learning can be severely affected by poor attendance and some schools in the State report that more than fifteen percent of students miss fifteen or more days of school a year; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Board of Education has a general policy on attendance and each school has its own attendance policy; and
 
     WHEREAS, those attendance policies cannot be effective without the school community providing meaningful support to promote attendance by all students; and

     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Board of Education is requested to require each school community council to review its school's attendance policy, establish benchmarks to improve attendance, and develop an implementation plan to meet those benchmarks; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board of Education report to the Chairs of the Senate Committee on Education and the House Committee on Education on the progress of each school community council in reviewing its school's attendance policy, establishing benchmarks to improve attendance, and developing an implementation plan, no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a group of representatives from the school community councils, as selected by the Chairs of the Senate Committee on Education and the House Committee on Education, report to the Legislature on their accomplishments in meeting their benchmarks of improved student attendance no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2014; and
