STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING A REVIEW OF THE STATE'S FUNDING FOR EXISTING ESL PROGRAMS AND HAWAIIAN LANGUAGE PROGRAMS OFFERED IN HAWAII AND ANY DISPARITIES IN FUNDING FOR THE STATE'S TWO OFFICIAL LANGUAGES.
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Hawaiian language was once a thriving language spoken and read by Native Hawaiians and foreigners alike; and
 
     WHEREAS, by the late twentieth century, however, the Hawaiian language was pushed to the brink of extinction due to a number of factors, including an 1896 law that banned the speaking of the Hawaiian language in Hawaii schools; and
 
     WHEREAS, fortunately, the Hawaiian language was saved by several historic initiatives, but fluent speakers are still in the minority; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Hawaiian language is a critical component of the heritage of the State of Hawaii, and the State has a solemn obligation to perpetuate the Hawaiian language; and
 
     WHEREAS, the federal Native American Languages Act of 1990 recognizes the United States' responsibility to ensure the survival of Native American languages and establishes the nation's policy of encouraging and supporting the use of Native American languages as a medium of instruction to help preserve those languages; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Hawaii State Constitution recognizes the Hawaiian language as one of the two official languages of the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, numerous programs in the State receive funding to promote English as a Second Language (ESL), but funding for Hawaiian language immersion and other Hawaiian language programs is far more limited; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the University of Hawaii, with the assistance of the Department of Education and other educational organizations, as appropriate, is requested to review the State's funding for existing ESL programs and Hawaiian language programs offered in Hawaii and any disparities in funding for the State's two official languages; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the University of Hawaii is requested to report its findings and recommendations, including projected costs to address any disparities in funding, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the President of the University of Hawaii System and the Superintendent of Education.
