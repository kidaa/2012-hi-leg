     (1)  Replacing every still-valid electronic benefits transfer card with a card that contains on its face a photo of the cardholder;
     (2)  "Phasing in" new photo identification cards issued under any current contract with any current electronic benefits transfer card vendor; and
     (3)  Implementing photo identification cards pursuant to the federal waiver through a new request for proposals once the contract with any current electronic benefits transfer card vendor expires.
     If the federal waiver is received, the legislature shall determine whether to implement the federal waiver based upon the cost findings.
