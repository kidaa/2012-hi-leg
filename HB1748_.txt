TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO INVASIVE SPECIES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that invasive species can wreak havoc on Hawaii's fragile ecosystem, environment, and agricultural lands.  Invasive species, such as the brown tree snake, coqui frogs, and the rosy wolf snail can damage the balance of the State's ecosystem, threaten native forest vertebrate species, precipitate power outages affecting private, commercial, and military activities, cause widespread loss of domestic birds and pets, and provoke considerable emotional trauma to residents and visitors alike when venomous snakes invade human habitats.
     In Guam, the brown tree snake was responsible for devastating the majority of the native bird population, and due to the availability of prey and lack of predators in introduced habitats such as Guam, they have been known to grow to sizes larger than their normal one to two meters (3.3 to 6.6 feet) in length.  To minimize the incidents of accidental migration of invasive animal species, trained dogs have been used successfully to search, locate, and assist in the removal of migratory invasive species prior to the departures of outbound military and commercial cargo and transportation vessels from the State.
     The purpose of this Act is to establish an invasive species detection and prevention pilot program within the department of agriculture, using dogs that are cross-trained to detect and prevent the entry of invasive species, including the brown tree snake.
     SECTION 2.  There is established within the department of agriculture an invasive species detection and prevention pilot program that uses trained dogs to detect migratory invasive species harbored in cargo carried by military and commercial transportation vessels before the cargo is released.
     The invasive species detection and prevention program shall contract with private dog handlers within the State to provide and cross-train dogs to detect various migratory invasive species.
     SECTION 3.  The department of agriculture shall submit to the legislature not later than twenty days prior to the convening of the 2013 regular session a report on the efficacy of the invasive species detection and prevention pilot program established by this Act.
     SECTION 4.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $        or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the funding for the invasive species detection and prevention pilot program within the department of agriculture.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of agriculture for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
