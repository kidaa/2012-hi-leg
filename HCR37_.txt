STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES INTERNET RETAILERS TO OFFER SHIPPING FEES FOR POSTAGE TO ALASKA AND HAWAII THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO SHIPPING FEES FOR POSTAGE TO THE FORTY-EIGHT CONTIGUOUS STATES.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, many internet retailers advertise sales and other promotional events that feature free or reduced shipping fees for customers; and
 
     WHEREAS, many of these retail merchants' websites are accessed by businesses and individual consumers in Hawaii who wish to take advantage of offers for free or discounted shipping for internet orders; and
 
     WHEREAS, however, these discounted or free shipping rates are frequently available only to customers who live in the contiguous forty-eight states and are not available to customers who request their order to be shipped to Hawaii or Alaska; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii customers of internet retailers are routinely charged disproportionately higher shipping fees than other customers who live in the forty-eight contiguous states; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the United States Congress is requested to pass legislation that requires internet retailers to offer shipping fees for shipment to Alaska and Hawaii that are comparable to shipping fees for goods that are sent to any of the forty-eight contiguous states; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, members of Hawaii's congressional delegation, and the United States Postmaster General.
