    (3)  I have been informed by my attorney and understand that my spouse or reciprocal beneficiary's, or my failure to appoint or re-appoint each other as a beneficiary after the divorce, annulment, or termination will, except in limited circumstances, result in the loss of his or her, or my interest in all inheritance rights, insurance or retirement benefit arrangements, or representative or fiduciary appointments or arrangements currently in place between my spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, and me.
