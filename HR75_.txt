HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE'S EFFORTS TO STIMULATE THE STATE'S AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY, INCREASE AND DIVERSIFY AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT, AND PROMOTE FOOD SECURITY.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the local agriculture industry is vital to the State's economy and the public's well-being; and
 
WHEREAS, in 2008, the Department of Agriculture established a biosecurity program to prevent the entry into the State and interisland movement of pests and prohibited organisms and to promote the production of agricultural commodities in the State, thus reducing shipments of imported cargo; and
 
WHEREAS, during the Regular Session of 2012, the Department of Agriculture introduced legislation to establish an agricultural development and food security program that seeks to increase agricultural sustainability and improve the economic viability of the State's agriculture industry; and
    
     WHEREAS, diversified agriculture results in a variety of locally grown and produced agricultural products available for local consumption and for export and increases the viability of the agriculture industry in the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, the agriculture development and food security program and development of the farm to market concept would increase the State's self-sufficiency, job opportunities, and agricultural product exports and, in turn, would diversify the State's economy; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that this body strongly supports the Department of Agriculture's programs to expand Hawaii's agriculture industry and recognizes that the establishment of the agricultural development and food security program is important to stimulate the State's economy; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor; Chairperson of the Board of Agriculture; and Director of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism.
