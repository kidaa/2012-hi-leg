TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO SOLID WASTE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that as the population of Hawaii has grown in recent years, the amount of waste entering the waste stream, and ultimately Hawaii's landfills, has increased as well.  The legislature further finds that the capacity for disposing of solid waste continues to diminish in the State.  With available landfill space running out in the face of population growth and economic development, and few options for acquiring more disposal space, it is important for the State to re-assess its waste reduction goals.  
Act 324, Session Laws of Hawaii 1991, established aggressive goals to reduce the solid waste stream by twenty-five per cent by 1995 and by fifty per cent by 2000.  In continuing to address these concerns, the legislature finds that further reductions in the waste stream are necessary to preserve the sustainability of the State and its growth. 
The purpose of this Act is to establish the goal of reducing the solid waste stream in the State by seventy-five per cent by 2015.
     SECTION 2.  Section 342G-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  It is the goal of the State to reduce the solid waste stream prior to disposal by:
     (1)  Twenty-five per cent by January 1, 1995; [and]
     (2)  Fifty per cent by January 1, 2000; and
     (3)  Seventy-five per cent by January 1, 2015,
through source reduction, recycling, and bioconversion.  Where feasible, the office shall establish other state goals for specific commodities, recognizing market considerations.
     No later than January 1, 2013, the counties shall incorporate these goals into their revised integrated solid waste management plans under part III.
     The director shall adopt rules to provide appropriate penalties for any county that fails to achieve these goals in a timely manner."
     SECTION 3.  The department of health shall submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2012, detailing past progress in solid waste reduction in the State and future strategies and methods that will assist the counties in meeting the solid waste reduction goals in this Act.
     SECTION 4.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
