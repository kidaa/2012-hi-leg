A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO GOVERNMENT.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that federal legislation, referred to as the "Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act" has been considered by the United States Congress since 2000, and remains under consideration.  As Congress continues its deliberations on this critical measure, it is the intent of the legislature to address the State's response by:
     (1)  Expressing the policy of the State of Hawaii regarding its relationship with Native Hawaiians; and
     (2)  Providing a process for the reorganization of a first nation government by Native Hawaiians and its subsequent recognition by the State of Hawaii.
     SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
"CHAPTER
FIRST NATION GOVERNMENT
     §   -1  Findings.  The legislature finds that:
     (1)  Native Hawaiians, the native people of the Hawaiian archipelago that is now part of the United States and the State of Hawaii, are the indigenous, native peoples of the State of Hawaii, and the Native Hawaiian people are a distinctly native community;
     (2)  The State of Hawaii has a special political and legal relationship with, and has long enacted legislation to promote the welfare of, the Native Hawaiian people;
     (3)  The United States, through Congress, exercised its constitutional authority to confirm a treaty between the United States and the government that represented the Native Hawaiian people, and from 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, extended full diplomatic recognition to the Hawaiian government, and entered into treaties and conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.
     (4)  Pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42), the United States set aside approximately 203,500 acres of land in trust to better address the conditions of Native Hawaiians in the federal territory that later became the State of Hawaii and in enacting the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, Congress acknowledged the Native Hawaiian people as a native people of the United States, as evidenced by the committee report, which notes that Congress relied on the Indian affairs power and the War Powers, including the power to make peace;
     (5)  By setting aside 203,500 acres of land in trust for Native Hawaiian homesteads and farms, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, assists the members of the Native Hawaiian community in maintaining distinctly native communities throughout the State of Hawaii;
     (6)  Approximately 9,800 Native Hawaiian families reside on the Hawaiian home lands, and approximately 25,000 Native Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian home lands are on a waiting list to receive assignments of Hawaiian home lands;
     (7)  In 1959, as part of the compact with the United States admitting Hawaii into the Union, Congress delegated the authority and responsibility to administer the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, lands in trust for Native Hawaiians and established a new public trust, commonly known as the ceded lands trust, for five purposes, one of which is the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, and Congress thereby reaffirmed its recognition of the Native Hawaiians as a distinctly native community with a direct lineal and historical succession to the aboriginal, indigenous people of Hawaii.  The public trust consists of lands, including submerged lands, natural resources, and the revenues derived from the lands; and the assets of this public trust have never been completely inventoried or segregated;
     (8)  Native Hawaiians have continuously sought access to the ceded lands in order to establish and maintain native settlements and distinct native communities throughout the State;
     (9)  The Hawaiian home lands and other ceded lands provide important native land reserves and resources for the Native Hawaiian community to maintain the practice of Native Hawaiian culture, language, and traditions, and for the continuity, survival, and economic self-sufficiency of the Native Hawaiian people as a distinctly native political community;
    (10)  Native Hawaiians continue to maintain other distinctly native areas in Hawaii, including native lands that date back to the ali‘i and kuleana lands reserved under the Kingdom of Hawaii;
    (11)  Through the Sovereign Councils of Hawaiian Homelands Assembly and Native Hawaiian homestead associations, Native Hawaiian civic associations, charitable trusts established by the Native Hawaiian ali‘i, nonprofit native service providers, and other community associations, the Native Hawaiian people have actively maintained native traditions and customary usages throughout the Native Hawaiian community, and the federal and state courts have continuously recognized the right of the Native Hawaiian people to engage in certain customary practices and usages on public lands;
    (12)  In 1978, the State of Hawaii held a constitutional convention at which the office of Hawaiian affairs was established, approved by the voters on November 7, 1978, (article XII, sections 5 and 6, Hawaii State Constitution), and codified as chapter 10, Hawaii Revised Statutes;
    (13)  At the 1978 constitutional convention, the State of Hawaii also found that many Native Hawaiian values and rights should be included in the Hawaii State Constitution, and the election of November 1978 also established state affirmation and protection of "all rights, customarily and traditionally exercised for subsistence, cultural and religious purposes and possessed by ahupua‘a tenants who are descendants of native Hawaiians who inhabited the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778, subject to the right of the State to regulate such rights."  (Article XII, section 7, Hawaii State Constitution);
    (14)  The creation of the office of Hawaiian affairs and the expression of Native Hawaiian rights in the Hawaii State Constitution reflect the constitutional convention's acknowledgement that assets and rights for Native Hawaiians were long overdue;
    (15)  On November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. 1510), commonly known as the "Apology Resolution", was enacted into law, extending an apology to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the United States' role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii;
    (16)  The Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States, and further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum;
    (17)  The Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of Congress and the President to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and to support reconciliation efforts between the United States and Native Hawaiians; and to have Congress and the President, through the President's designated officials, consult with Native Hawaiians on the reconciliation process as called for under the Apology Resolution;
    (18)  Pursuant to the Apology Resolution, the United States Departments of Justice and the Interior conducted reconciliation hearings with the Native Hawaiian people in 1999 and issued a joint report entitled, "From Mauka to Makai:  The River of Justice Must Flow Freely", which identified promoting the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government as a priority recommendation for continuing the process of reconciliation;
    (19)  Despite the overthrow of the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their separate identity as a single distinctly native political community through cultural, social, and political institutions, and to give expression to their rights as native people to self-determination, self-governance, and economic self-sufficiency;
    (20)  There is clear continuity between the aboriginal, indigenous, native people of the Kingdom of Hawaii and their successors, the Native Hawaiian people today;
    (21)  Native Hawaiians have also given expression to their rights as native people to self-determination, self-governance, and economic self-sufficiency through the provision of governmental services to Native Hawaiians, including the provision of health care services, educational programs, employment and training programs, economic development assistance programs, children's services, conservation programs, fish and wildlife protection, agricultural programs, native language immersion programs, native language immersion schools from kindergarten through high school, college and master's degree programs in native language immersion instruction, and traditional justice programs; and by continuing their efforts to enhance Native Hawaiian self-determination and local control;
    (22)  Native Hawaiian people are actively engaged in Native Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources;
    (23)  The Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations of Native Hawaiians their lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural identity in accordance with their traditions, beliefs, customs and practices, language, and social and political institutions; to control and manage their own lands, including ceded lands; and to achieve greater self-determination over their own affairs;
    (24)  This chapter provides a process for the Native Hawaiian people to exercise their inherent rights as a distinct, indigenous, native community to reorganize a first nation government for the purpose of giving expression to their rights as a native people to self-determination and self-governance;
    (25)  The United States has:
         (A)  Declared that the United States has a special political and legal relationship for the welfare of the native peoples of the United States, including Native Hawaiians;
         (B)  Identified Native Hawaiians as an indigenous, distinctly native people of the United States within the scope of its authority under the Constitution of the United States of America, and has enacted scores of statutes on their behalf; and
         (C)  Delegated broad authority to the State of Hawaii to administer some of the United States' responsibilities as they relate to the Native Hawaiian people and their lands;
    (26)  The United States has recognized and reaffirmed the special political and legal relationship with the Native Hawaiian people through the enactment of the Act entitled, "An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union", approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; 73 Stat. 4), by:
         (A)  Ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those lands be held as a public trust for five purposes, one of which is for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians; and
         (B)  Transferring the United States' responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian home lands to the State of Hawaii, but retaining the exclusive right of the United States to consent to any actions affecting the lands included in the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42), that are enacted by the legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting the beneficiaries under the Act; and
    (27)  The United States has continually recognized and reaffirmed that:
         (A)  Native Hawaiians have a direct genealogical, cultural, historic, and land-based connection to their forebears, the aboriginal, indigenous, native people who exercised original sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands;
         (B)  Native Hawaiians have never relinquished their claims to sovereignty or their sovereign lands;
         (C)  The United States extends services to Native Hawaiians because of their unique status as the native people of a prior-sovereign nation with whom the United States has a special political and legal relationship; and
         (D)  The special relationship of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to the United States arises out of their status as aboriginal, indigenous, native people of the United States.
