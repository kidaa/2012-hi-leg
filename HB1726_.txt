TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO ENERGY.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii, as an isolated island state, is highly dependent on imported oil.  To promote self-sufficiency in energy and power production, Hawaii has taken many steps to develop alternate sources of energy.  One such step was to enact Act 253, Session Laws of Hawaii 2007, which, among other things, established the energy systems development special fund to provide monies for the development of an integrated approach and portfolio management of renewable energy and energy efficiency technology projects.  Three years later, Act 73, Session Laws of Hawaii 2010, made the environmental response, energy, and food security tax the main source of funding for the energy systems development special fund.  However, Act 73, Session Laws of Hawaii 2010, set the environmental response, energy, and food security tax to repeal in 2015, while the energy systems development special fund was inadvertently left to repeal in 2012.
     The purpose of this bill is to align the repeal dates of the energy systems development special fund and the environmental response, energy, and food security tax by extending the repeal date of the energy systems development special fund to 2015.     
     SECTION 2.  Act 253, Session Laws of Hawaii 2007, is amended by amending section 8 to read as follows:
     "SECTION 8.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2007; provided that sections 304A-C, 304A-D, and 304A-E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, shall be repealed on June 30,[2012.] 2015."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on June 29, 2012.
