     "§36-     Online reporting; monthly updates.  (a)    Not later than January 1, 2013, the director of finance, in accordance with this section, shall establish, implement, and maintain a single searchable website, updated on a monthly basis, accessible by the public at no cost to users, that includes but is not limited to:

(2)  The appropriated and allocated amounts for each account, and expenditures to date; and
(3)  A monthly summary of income received, expenditures made, balances remaining, costs incurred but not yet expended, cash on hand, and any related information that may assist the legislature and members of the public in understanding the fiscal condition of the State.
     (b)  The director of finance is authorized to designate one or more state agencies to participate in the development, establishment, maintenance, and support of the website.
