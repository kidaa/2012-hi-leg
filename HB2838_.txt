TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
DESIGNATING FEBRUARY AS HAWAIIAN GROWN CACAO MONTH.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

SECTION 1.  The legislature also finds that cacao, derived from the theobroma cacao tree, is the dried and fermented seed from which chocolate is obtained, native to the central and western Amazon region and is widely distributed throughout the humid tropical regions with commercial production concentrated in Brazil, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Indonesia and Nigeria.
The legislature finds that the cacao industry in Hawai`i is in its infancy stage with fewer than 30 growers and a total acreage of approximately 50 acres, but holds the promise of helping diversified agriculture markets and the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (UH-CTAHR) has conducted series of meetings, including the one-day workshop entitled "Future of Cacao in Hawai`i" held October 23, 2008, involving key stakeholders in the local cacao industry and representatives statewide to strategize on methods for positioning Hawai`i in the growing cacao market.
The legislature also finds that cacao was first introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1850; Hawai`i's environment and climate position it as the only state in the United States that can commercially grow cacao and as the state which is in close proximity to both Asia and mainland U.S.A and is ideally located to capture and prosper from the opportunities of a growing cacao market which currently generates $75 billion worldwide annually; and that it has wide-ranging uses for consumer products such as cacao butter, which is rich in anti-oxidants, for use as medicinal and cosmetic purposes, a stimulant similar to coffee, and can also be used as a vasodilator (blood-vessel widener) and heart stimulant.
     The legislature further finds that the cacao industry is poised to heighten the State's economy with a broad range of job opportunities and increased revenue from diversified agriculture, production and processing, in addition to research and development with the potential to attract federal funds; further, cacao possesses a propitious opportunity to develop a new industry in the growing, cultivating, processing, and shipping of Hawai`i-grown cacao to the mainland United States and the rest of the world.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 8, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§8-      Hawaiian Grown Cacao month.  The month of February shall be known and designated as "Hawaiian Grown Cacao month."  This month is not and shall not be construed as a state holiday."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
