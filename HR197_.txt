CONGRATULATING THE RADFORD HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADING TEAM FOR ITS OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT IN BECOMING THE 2012 NATIONAL CHEERLEADING ASSOCIATION GRAND NATIONAL CHAMPION.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, with seven consecutive Hawaii State Championships, seven National Championships in the past twelve years in their division and two Grand National Championships in the past three years, the Radford High School Cheerleading Team has been a dominating force in the realm of competitive cheerleading here in the State of Hawaii and across the United States; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Radford High School Cheerleading Team competed against more than two hundred teams from across the nation, including champion teams from the states of California, Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana, Iowa, Illinois and Alaska, and attained the title of Overall Grand National Champion for the second time in three years; and
 
     WHEREAS, by dedicating countless hours every week to both practice and year-round performances at official school functions and athletic events, the Radford High School Cheerleading Team continually displays unwavering dedication to achieving excellence; and
 
     WHEREAS, Team Captains Ridge Frank, Amber Bookhard, and Kyly Antonio displayed their exemplary leadership abilities in mentoring and guiding teammates, helping them to hone their abilities and develop the skills necessary to become State and National Champions; and
 
     WHEREAS, Radford High School represents a large military community, with the majority of its students being the children of active duty members in military service, many of whom will relocate to different cities and states, never certain of the high school from which they might graduate; and
 
     WHEREAS, through commitment and perseverance, members of the Radford High School Cheerleading Team have continually overcome the challenges of belonging to an unpredictable and transient student population and have reached the pinnacle of achievement in the world of competitive cheerleading and, under the guidance and direction of Coaches Bo Frank and Tom Luna, were again able to overcome significant odds and capture the title of 2012 Grand National Champions in Dallas, Texas; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Radford High School Cheerleading Team stands as a testament to the potential of Hawaii's public school students and educators, as proof that with hard work, devotion and passion come unimaginable rewards, as an example for peers and classmates to emulate and aspire to, as a stunning illustration of athleticism, and as an enduring and endearing object of state prestige and school pride; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that this body hereby commends the members of the Radford High School Cheerleading Team on attaining the title of 2012 Grand National Champions at the National Cheerleading Association Senior and Junior High School National Championships in Dallas, Texas, and wishes them continued success in all of their future endeavors.
