TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO AGRICULTURE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Good agricultural practices are guidelines designed by the Food and Drug Administration and United States Department of Agriculture to produce safe products and eliminate potential for product contamination.  Good agricultural practices, among other things, include guidance on human hygiene, animals and their manures, water quality for irrigation and produce rinse, and agricultural pesticides.  These standards are being adopted by the world's leading farmers, who understand that they have a responsibility to provide the safest food possible to consumers.
     Many of Hawaii's growers are not implementing the good agricultural practices standards.  This failure to follow science-based, risk-adverse food production practices is made worse by the existence of the rat lungworm nematode in Hawaii.  When consumed, this nematode can cause serious illness, as has happened numerous times during the past couple years.
     Established as a Hawaii nonprofit corporation in 2009, 4Ag Hawaii, is a collaborative private-public sector partnership focused on sustainable agricultural economic developments.  The partnership is committed to raising the awareness of the importance of agriculture and expanding the agricultural industry in Hawaii.  One of 4Ag Hawaii's goals is to promote and conduct economic and educational programs.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds so that 4Ag Hawaii may expand the outreach and e-educational initiatives begun in 2010 and enhance those initiatives through increased participation by the department of education, the visitor industry, and the agricultural and educational communities.  The legislature finds that this Act will serve a public purpose by helping the State move towards improved food safety and security.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $500,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 as a grant pursuant to chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to the 4Ag Hawaii nonprofit corporation to expand its outreach and e-educational initiatives begun in 2010.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of agriculture for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
