TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO KALO APPRECIATION MONTH.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Kalo (Colocasia esculenta), the Hawaiian word for taro, is a culturally significant plant to the kanaka maoli, Hawaii's indigenous peoples, and to the State.  In 2008, the legislature recognized kalo's role in the State's history and well-being by designating kalo as the state plant.  As Hawaiian culture and the sustainability movement have flourished over the past few decades, so has the resurrection of taro cultivation and its popular byproduct: poi.  
     The legislature finds that while varieties of taro grow in almost all tropical regions of the world, Hawaii seems to have some of the strongest taro traditions.  Taro is a plant of unique and distinctive character which was brought to a higher state of cultivation in old Hawaii than anywhere else in the world.  Native cultivation of taro in Hawaii created more varieties adaptable to varying conditions of locale, soil, and water than are to be found anywhere else in Polynesia or the world.
     The purpose of this Act is to establish the month of October as "Kalo Appreciation Month" to promote kalo cultivation and appreciation.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§8-    Kalo Appreciation Month.  The month of October shall be known and designated as "Kalo Appreciation Month".  The month of October shall celebrate the strong kalo tradition in Hawaii and the cultural connection of kalo, the Hawaiian word for taro, to native Hawaiians.  This month is not and shall not be construed as a state holiday."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
