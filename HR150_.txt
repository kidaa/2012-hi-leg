TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO ADOPT RULES TO REQUIRE ELECTRIC UTILITY COMPANIES TO PERMIT GROUP NET METERING.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, Hawaii has supported its growing solar energy market with incentives including tax credits, net metering, and feed-in tariffs; and
 
     WHEREAS, numerous policies have been introduced to encourage the use of renewable energy in the State and to work toward the goals of the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative; and
 
     WHEREAS, although incentives have encouraged many residential users to invest in solar technology for their homes, only twenty-two to twenty-seven percent of residential buildings in the State are suitable for hosting on-site photovoltaic energy systems due to structural features, shading, or ownership issues; and
 
     WHEREAS, solar energy programs need to provide options for residents and tenants in multi-unit buildings, residences, and other buildings with rooftops that cannot accommodate photovoltaic system placement, and for persons who otherwise cannot install a photovoltaic system on-site; and
 
     WHEREAS, group net metering means the elective combination of a group of customers or the multiple meters of a single customer as a single billing entity for the purpose of collective metering of electricity consumption; and
 
     WHEREAS, other states and municipalities have used group net metering to make photovoltaic energy generation more widely accessible to households and consumers and broaden investment in solar energy; and
 
     WHEREAS, in addition to making photovoltaic energy more accessible, participation in a group net metering program can help consumers lower their up-front purchase costs for solar energy systems; and
 
     WHEREAS, group net metering may also help the State reach its solar energy goals by accelerating solar purchases; and
 
     WHEREAS, virtual net metering, a type of group net metering that is available to entire communities, enables participants to receive utility bill credits or another agreed-upon form of compensation for the electricity produced by their share of a jointly-owned photovoltaic system; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Public Utilities Commission is requested to adopt rules to enable group net metering that at a minimum prescribe:
 
(1)  The number of customer-generators that may participate in a group net metering system;
 
(2)  The allowable geographic distribution of customers that may participate in a group net metering system;
 
(3)  The total number of kilowatts that may be aggregated among all customers participating in a group net metering system;
 
(4)  The distribution of excess electricity credits among meters or customers within a group net metering system; and
 
(5)  A standard contract or tariff providing for group net metering, which shall not affect the rate classes for customers who participate in group net metering; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that electric utility companies are requested to provide group net metering at the request of an eligible customer generator; and       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Chairperson of the Public Utilities Commission, the Presidents of Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc., Maui Electric Company Ltd., and Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc., and the Chairperson of the Board of Kauai Island Utility Cooperative.
