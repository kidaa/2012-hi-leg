TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Negotiable instruments have been abused, endorsed in bank, lost, or not timely assigned to trusts; and where negotiable instruments are not recorded for public records, an electronic copy is sufficient evidence that the person holding a "copy" is the actual holder.  Advanced printing technology can make copies that are almost perfect where only a forensics examiner can tell the difference.  Digital system copies are not reliable sources of actual ownership.
     SECTION 2.  Section 490:1-201, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending the definition of "holder" to read as follows:
     ""Holder" means:
     (1)  The person in possession of a negotiable instrument that is payable either to bearer or to an identified person that is the person in possession; or
     (2)  The person in possession of a negotiable tangible document of title if the goods are deliverable either to bearer or to the order of the person in possession[; or].
    [(3)  The person in control of a negotiable electronic document of title.]"
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
