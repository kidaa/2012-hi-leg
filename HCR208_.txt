HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE TO ADDRESS THE DANGEROUSLY LOW LEVEL OF IRRIGATION WATER SUPPLY AND IMPROVE THE AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, drought conditions in recent years have significantly reduced watershed capacities across the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, the stored irrigation water supply is no longer capable of meeting the minimum summer crop demand; and
 
     WHEREAS, irrigation water use restrictions have caused significant economic loss in affected communities; and
 
     WHEREAS, security of the fragile agricultural economy is now at risk; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Molokai Irrigation System storage levels are at fifty per cent of 2011 levels, and rainfall in the service area stands at less than ten per cent of normal; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Molokai Irrigation System user community has operated under a thirty per cent restriction for almost three years, at a cost of ninety jobs and more than $2,000,000 in lost revenue; and
 
     WHEREAS, an increased supply of irrigation water to meet realistic existing user demand can provide a significant economic benefit to island communities, including one hundred thirty new jobs on the island of Molokai; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Agriculture is requested to address the dangerously low level of irrigation water supply and improve the agricultural economy by:
 
     (1)  Developing a three year plan for additional irrigation water source development to meet existing Molokai Irrigation System user demand within the various service areas;
 
     (2)  Providing an estimate of capital funding requirements to develop basal groundwater well sources;
 
     (3)  Develop necessary engineering data utilizing existing hydrological data;
 
     (4)  Seeking capital funding for project development;
 
     (5)  Seeking Commission on Water Resource Management water use permits or increases in existing permits within the known limitations of aquifer sustainable yields; and
 
     (6)  Considering that increased irrigation water sales have significant potential to pay back the amortized cost of the capital invested; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Agriculture is requested to submit a report to the Legislature containing its findings and recommendations, together with any proposed legislation, not later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Chairperson of the Board of Agriculture and the Chairperson of the Molokai Irrigation System Water Users Advisory Board.
