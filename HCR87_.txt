STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE UNITED STATES TO RECOGNIZE THE RECOVERY OF HAWAIIAN GREEN SEA TURTLES AND BEGIN ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THIS IMPORTANT SPECIES.
 
 
 

WHEREAS, in 1978, the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) was listed as a threatened and protected species under the Endangered Species Act; and
 
WHEREAS, because green sea turtles were classified as a threatened and protected species worldwide, the Hawaiian green sea turtle, known as honu, was to receive the same protections, including cessation of harvesting as a traditional Hawaiian source of food, despite protests by the State and people of Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, in the early 1970s, the State of Hawaii developed a management plan to limit the hunting of honu in Hawaii by requiring permits and reporting; and
 
     WHEREAS, today, scientific studies as well as reports by Native Hawaiian lawaia (cultural practitioners of fishing) have concluded that the honu is approaching full recovery and that the environment and ecosystem are suffering from the current over-protection, over-population, and lack of management of honu; and
 
     WHEREAS, on June 16, 2011, Fishers Forum:  The Future of Honu Management, was convened by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council to inform the public about the status of honu and the Endangered Species Act process for delisting species and to initiate community dialogue regarding the future management of the honu; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Recovery Plan for the United States Pacific Populations of the Green Sea Turtle of 1998 requires that a management plan be in place to maintain sustained populations of green sea turtles for the species to be considered for delisting; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the United States is urged to recognize the recovery of the Hawaiian green sea turtle and begin active management of this important species; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the National Marine Fisheries Service and United States Fish and Wildlife Service are urged to designate the Hawaiian green turtle as a distinct population segment and delist it from the threatened list under the Endangered Species Act; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Regional Administrator of the National Marine Fisheries Service, Pacific Islands Regional Office; the Chairperson of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council; the Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources; and the members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.
