TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE COMMISSION ON FATHERHOOD.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature established the state commission on fatherhood in 2003 in recognition of the important and unique role fathers play in the lives of their children, families, and communities.  Chapter 577E, Hawaii Revised Statutes, directs the commission to serve in an advisory capacity to state agencies to promote healthy family relationships between parents and children.  In recognition of the commission's value and the need to continue to promote and support healthy families in Hawaii, the legislature established the commission as a permanent entity within the State in 2007. 
     The legislature finds that the term of office of the members of the commission on fatherhood should be extended from two years to four years to provide for institutional knowledge and continuity.
SECTION 2.  Section 577E-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:
     "(c)  All members shall serve for a term of [two] four years.  Any vacancies occurring in the membership of the commission shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term in the same manner as the original appointments.  No member shall serve on the commission for more than two terms; provided that if a member fills a vacancy and serves for the remainder of an unexpired term that member shall be considered to have served one term."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
