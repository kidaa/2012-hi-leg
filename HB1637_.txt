TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE STATE TREE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the state tree should be a reflection of our unique island home.  The ‘ōhi‘a lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) is the most common native tree in the Hawaiian islands and is found nowhere else in the world.
     The ‘ōhi‘a lehua grows at nearly all altitudes, from over six thousand feet in the mountains down to the sea.  Not only is ‘ōhi‘a lehua vital to Hawaii's watershed forests, its nectar is also the mainstay of our brilliant native honeycreepers.
     The ‘ōhi‘a lehua is the pioneer tree growing from new lava flows, beginning the cycle of life on previously barren ground.  It is the living symbol of major Hawaiian deities, including Pele, Laka, and Ku, and its wood is valued the world over for its beauty and strength.
     SECTION 2.  Section 5-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§5-8  State tree.  The [kukui tree, also known as the candlenut tree (Aleurites Moluccana),] ohia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) is adopted, established, and designated as the official tree of the State, to be effective so long as the legislature of the State does not otherwise provide."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
