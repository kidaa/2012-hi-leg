HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE BOARD OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE, NO LATER THAN DECEMBER 15, 2012, ON THE PROGRESS OF THE KOKE‘E STATE PARK ADVISORY COUNCIL.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, Act 223, Session Laws of Hawaii 2008, established the Koke‘e state park advisory council ("advisory council") within the Department of Land and Natural Resources; and
 
     WHEREAS, under section 171-8.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the responsibilities of the advisory council include:
 
     (1)  Reviewing and assisting in updating and revising the Koke‘e state park master plan;
 
     (2)  Advising and assisting in the management of the Koke‘e recreational cabin leases;
 
     (3)  Enhancing community education and cultural awareness of Koke‘e state park;
 
     (4)  Participating in the protection and preservation of Koke‘e state park's natural and cultural resources; and
 
     (5)  Advising and assisting in the overall implementation of the Koke‘e state park master plan; and
 
     WHEREAS, neither Act 223, Session Laws of Hawaii 2008, nor section 171-8.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, provides the means by which to hold the advisory council accountable for fulfilling its responsibilities; and
 
     WHEREAS, it has been nearly three years since the creation of the advisory council, but it is unclear what the advisory council has done with regard to implementation of the Koke‘e state park master plan; and
 
     WHEREAS, once the master plan is adopted and implemented, the State can start assessing user fees, which would generate up to $300,000 in annual revenue and would help with the cost of maintaining the Koke‘e state park and beginning much-needed repairs to Koke‘e state park facilities; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources is requested to report to the Legislature, no later than December 15, 2012, on the progress of the Koke‘e state park advisory council with regard to implementation of the Koke‘e state park master plan; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature requests that the report include the advisory council's recommendations for implementation of the Koke‘e state park master plan; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature requests that the master plan be adopted, no later than December 15, 2012, and that upon adoption of the master plan, but no later than December 15, 2012, the advisory council shall be dissolved; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Chairperson of the Koke‘e state park advisory council, the Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
