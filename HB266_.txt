TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO WATER QUALITY STANDARDS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the intent of Act 126, Session Laws of Hawaii 2009, to revise certain state water quality standards for marine waters to conform to levels recommended by the State of Hawaii and the United States Environmental Protection Agency is maintained by deleting the Act's sunset date of June 30, 2011.  The legislature finds that:  these revisions are important to the economic and social development of the State; the revised standards are adequate to fully protect the designated and existing uses of the State's marine waters; and Act 126 should not be repealed until such time as the water quality standards adopted in sections 2 and 3 of Act 126 are replaced by an appropriately approved water quality standard.
     SECTION 2.  Act 126, Session Laws of Hawaii 2009, is amended by amending section 6 to read as follows:
     "SECTION 6.  This Act shall take effect upon approval; provided that:
     (1)  The specific water quality standards prescribed in this Act shall take effect upon their approval by the United States Environmental Protection Agency; and
     (2)  Any water quality standard adopted in section 2 or section 3 of this Act shall be repealed upon a same or corresponding standard being adopted, amended, or repealed by rules adopted under chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, by the department of health, and the rule being approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency; provided further that the remaining standards specified in this Act shall remain in effect[; and
     (3)  This Act shall be repealed on June 30, 2011]."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on June 29, 2011.
