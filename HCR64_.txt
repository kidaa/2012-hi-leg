HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
SUPPORTING THE CONCEPT OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT FUNDS.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, infrastructure investment funds provide a means for institutions and individuals to invest in public-private partnerships established to build and repair government facilities and systems; and
 
     WHEREAS, infrastructure investment funds can provide a stable, long-lived, high quality, inflation-hedged asset often desired by pension and superannuation plans; and
 
     WHEREAS, infrastructure investment funds provide a means for public sector pensions to invest in local infrastructure projects, thereby boosting local economies through increased construction while achieving public policy goals and offering pension holders an attractive risk-to-return profile; and
 
     WHEREAS, with the exception of railroads, the United States depends almost exclusively on government funds for construction of its public transportation infrastructure; and
 
     WHEREAS, public-private partnerships provide nongovernment sources of funding for public infrastructure projects; and
 
     WHEREAS, public-private partnerships can improve infrastructure efficiency by bundling maintenance and operations with the construction of the infrastructure project; and
 
     WHEREAS, public-private partnerships have an incentive to finish a project early and below budget because profits generally increase the earlier charges may be imposed on users; and
 
     WHEREAS, infrastructure investment funds can provide a gross target return of ten to fourteen per cent; and
 
     WHEREAS, infrastructure investment funds provide a variety of investment strategies, including termed investments focusing on terminal value, or funds without terms focusing on annual cash distributions; and
 
     WHEREAS, infrastructure investment funds can promote responsible contractors and subcontractors by investing solely in projects using a properly unionized workforce, ensuring proper safety protocols, and implementing other requirements of a responsible contractor policy; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Legislature expresses support for the infrastructure investment fund concept; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, the Director of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, the Director of Finance, and the Director of Transportation.
