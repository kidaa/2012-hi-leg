A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO CARGO INSPECTIONS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that in light of the State's geographical isolation and the numerous cargo containers arriving by air, it is imperative that the State broaden its authority to inspect incoming cargo to safeguard airport facilities, air passengers, and Hawaii residents against dangerous cargo arriving in the State.
     The purpose of this Act is to enhance inspections of incoming air cargo containers.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 261, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§261‑     Air cargo container inspections.  (a)  In addition to any other powers provided by law, the department may:
     (1)  Inspect any incoming air cargo container to detect and confiscate any material constituting a threat directly or indirectly to the security of life or property in the State, including explosives, invasive plant and animal species, and illegal drugs;
     (2)  Collaborate with any federal, state, or county agency to effectuate air cargo container inspections under this section; and
     (3)  Assess and collect a reasonable fee upon any article of air cargo for the cost of conducting inspections under this section.
     (b)  The department shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 necessary to implement this section."
     SECTION 3.  There is appropriated out of the airport revenue fund the sum of $            or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for         permanent full-time equivalent (      FTE) air cargo inspector positions.
     The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of transportation for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
