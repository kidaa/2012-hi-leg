TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
MAKING AN APPROPRIATION FOR LIFEGUARD SERVICES AT KEKAHA KAI STATE PARK.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Kua Bay, also known as Manini'owali, is part of the Kekaha Kai state park, which is located along the leeward coast of the island of Hawaii and is in close proximity to the major population area of Kailua-Kona.  Kua Bay marks the northern end of the state park and features several hiking trails and a number of lookout points.
     The legislature further finds that Kua Bay, though a small beach, can draw large crowds of more than five hundred persons a day.  As a result, the beach has effectively become an attractive nuisance particularly since the beach has a bathroom facility, paved road, and a convenient location close to Kailua-Kona.  However, this beach can be very dangerous for inexperienced surfers and body boarders, especially during the winter months, when the waves are particularly big and unpredictable.  Numerous neck, spinal, and head injuries have been reported at Kua Bay.  Many of these injuries could have been prevented if there had been a lifeguard on duty at the beach.
     The purpose of this Act is to make an appropriation to fund lifeguard services at Kekaha Kai state park.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the operational, personnel, and equipment costs for lifeguard services at Kekaha Kai state park.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of land and natural resources for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
