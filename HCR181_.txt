TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO ESTABLISH A MORATORIUM ON HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM RATE INCREASES UNTIL JUNE 30, 2014.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the cost-of-living for Hawaii residents is among the highest in the country, while average wages for Hawaii's workers are among the lowest; and
 
     WHEREAS, average wages in Hawaii have remained stagnant over the past three years and the unemployment level in the State has failed to show a significant decrease; and
 
     WHEREAS, premium rates for health insurance have risen steadily each year at a rate that has outpaced wage increases and makes this necessary expense difficult for many households to afford; and
 
     WHEREAS, a moratorium on rate increases for health insurance premiums would benefit the economy of Hawaii by stabilizing the cost-of-living and improving the finances of many households; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Insurance Commissioner is requested to establish a moratorium on premium rate increases requested by any health insurer, mutual benefit society, fraternal benefit society, or health maintenance organization until June 30, 2014, unless the Insurance Commissioner finds that extraordinary circumstances exist to justify the increase; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and the Insurance Commissioner.
