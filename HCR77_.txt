HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO SUPPORT AND ESTABLISH A NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the government of Australia has recently created the National Broadband Network, which is a wholesale-only open access high-speed broadband network that will deliver high-speed broadband to all Australians; and
 
     WHEREAS, the National Broadband Network will involve the laying of fiber optic cabling to ninety-three per cent of Australian homes, schools, and businesses, providing broadband speeds of up to one gigabit per second. The remaining premises will be connected via a combination of next-generation high-speed fixed wireless and satellite technologies delivering peak speeds of at twelve megabits per second; and
 
WHEREAS, the National Broadband Network is to expected to deliver significant improvements in broadband services for all Australians at affordable prices; support a new wave of digital innovation that will change and improve the way Australians live their lives, receive services, and connect with the world;  drive Australia’s productivity; transform service delivery in key areas such as health, education, and energy; connect big cities, regional centers, and rural communities; and reform the structure of Australia’s telecommunications sector to the benefit of all Australians; and
 
WHEREAS, the United States, like Australia, lags behind many other developed countries in its deployment of high-speed broadband communications networks across the country, and like Australia, is in need of a bold nationwide initiative to deploy high-speed broadband communications; and
 
     WHEREAS, high-speed broadband service in the United States is concentrated in major metropolitan areas, with little connectivity to other population centers or rural areas; and
 
     WHEREAS, there is no cohesive high-speed broadband network in the United States; rather, service is provided by a patchwork of different telecommunications networks, often with widely varying speeds and limited connectivity; and
 
     WHEREAS, the deployment of high-speed broadband across the United States should be a congressional priority to improve productivity, transform service delivery, and connect all areas of the country; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, urges the United States Congress to support and establish a national broadband network across the United States, modeled after Australia's National Broadband Network; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.
