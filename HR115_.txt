     WHEREAS, several community organizations use the arboretum as their base of operations, including Hui Hana, Garden Club of Honolulu, and the Arboretum Association; and
 
     WHEREAS, Manoa Road is the only road that provides access to the arboretum; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is unclear which entity owns the portion of Manoa Road leading to the entry to Lyon Arboretum and, therefore, which entity is responsible for road maintenance and repair; and

     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources is requested to convene a Manoa Road Task Force to examine and make a recommendation to resolve the ownership, maintenance, and repair responsibility of the portion of Manoa Road leading up to the Lyon Arboretum; and
