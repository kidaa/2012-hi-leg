HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU TO WAIVE ALL FINES RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION OF THE KUPUNA TERRACE IN WAIMANALO.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, for decades the Waimanalo community has asked for a beachside terrace and safe place for seniors and families to congregate; and
 
     WHEREAS, the community thoroughly cleaned and prepared a site under the jurisdiction of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands overlooking Rabbit Island that had been littered for decades by illegal dumping and overgrown invasive vegetation; and
 
     WHEREAS, in the best of Hawaiian traditions, the Waimanalo community came together to volunteer hundreds of work hours and donate more than $50,000 in construction materials to build a scenic park, named Kupuna Terrace, with eleven picnic tables for public use after receiving permission from the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to remove trash and cut overgrown vegetation from the land; and
 
     WHEREAS, Kupuna Terrace offered a peaceful and scenic reprieve that connected residents and visitors to the land and sea; and
 
     WHEREAS, Kupuna Terrace was a source of pride for the Waimanalo community, stood as a monument to strong community collaboration, and served as a model for what the community could accomplish without government assistance; and      WHEREAS, the City and County of Honolulu believes that the placement and structures of Kupuna Terrace were dangerous due to the sloping terrain, proximity to Kalanianaole Highway, and limited parking; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Waimanalo community is making every effort to work with the City and County of Honolulu to clear all remaining material and restore what was Kupuna Terrace back to its original state; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the City and County of Honolulu is requested to waive all fees and fines that the Waimanalo community has incurred or may incur in relation to the construction and demolition of the Kupuna Terrace; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the City and County of Honolulu is requested to allow adequate time for the proper restoration of this collaborative effort; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a certified copy of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu.
