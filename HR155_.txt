HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND TOURISM TO DETERMINE FINANCING MECHANISMS TO ASSIST PRIVATE PARKING LOT OWNERS WITH THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING PARKING STALLS AND CHARGING UNITS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, one of the Legislature's ongoing priorities has been promoting sustainability and exploring various options to lessen the State's dependency on fossil fuels; and
 
     WHEREAS, Act 290, Session Laws of Hawaii 1997, established the State policy to support and encourage the use of electric vehicles; and
 
     WHEREAS, Act 156, Session Laws of Hawaii 2009, furthered the promotion and development of alternative transportation by, among other things, requiring that parking facilities with at least 100 parking spaces designate one percent of the parking spaces exclusively for electric vehicles by December 31, 2011, and also requiring an electric vehicle charging unit; and
 
     WHEREAS, the federal government has also offered attractive tax incentives to taxpayers that purchase electric vehicles; and
 
     WHEREAS, while the Legislature continues to be supportive of these efforts, the needs of Hawaii's businesses must also be considered; and
 
     WHEREAS, the cost of installing an electric vehicle charging unit can be cost-prohibitive to businesses, with estimates ranging from $16,000 to $25,000, depending on the type of unit and infrastructure upgrade requirements; and      WHEREAS, the cost of the electric vehicle charging unit installed at the State Capitol in 2011 was approximately $8,000; and
 
     WHEREAS, incentives or subsidies to help the owners of private parking lots to defray the costs of the implementation of Act 156, Session Laws of Hawaii 2009, should be considered; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism is requested to determine financing mechanisms to assist private parking lot owners with the costs associated with providing parking stalls, electric vehicle charging units, and other requirements under Act 156, Session laws of Hawaii 2009; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Hawaii State Energy Office, through its Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative and its transportation technical working group, consider, among other things, funding mechanisms such as a surcharge to dealerships that sell electric vehicles and subsidies or tax incentives for businesses that are required to comply with Act 156, Session Laws of Hawaii 2009; and
