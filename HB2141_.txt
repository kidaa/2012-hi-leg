TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO EDUCATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known as the Safe Schools Act.
     SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that all students have the right to participate fully in the educational process, free from bullying, cyberbullying, and harassment.  A safe and civil environment in school is necessary for students to learn and to meet high academic standards.  Bullying, cyberbullying, and harassment, like other disruptive or violent behaviors, are forms of conduct that disrupt a student's ability to learn and a school's ability to educate its students in a safe environment.  The legislature finds that because students learn by example, school administrators, faculty, staff, parents, guardians, and volunteers should be expected to demonstrate appropriate behavior, treat others with civility and respect, and refuse to tolerate bullying and harassment.
     The purpose of this Act is to require the department of education, local school boards of public charter schools, and private schools to establish, maintain, monitor, and enforce all policies and procedures related to all forms of bullying and harassment to protect students.
     SECTION 3.  Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:

         (K)  That when bullying, cyberbullying, or harassment does occur, school personnel correct the offending behavior in a positive, consistent, and timely manner, utilizing these incidents as learning opportunities for individual students;
         (L)  Rewarding positive behaviors that help counter bullying, cyberbullying, and harassing behaviors; and

     (2)  Conducting and documenting annual training for all school personnel at the school level on how to promote peace and respect, how to intervene when students and adults are engaged in bullying, cyberbullying, or harassing behavior, and understanding the department's policy related to bullying, cyberbullying, and harassment.  For purposes of this paragraph, "school personnel" includes but is not limited to administrators, teachers, cafeteria workers, custodial workers, educational assistants, counselors, school-based behavioral health staff, health aides, clerical staff, special education evaluators, district-level personnel, security personnel, and any third party contractors and volunteers that have direct contact with students;
