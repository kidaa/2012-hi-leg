A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO INSURANCE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The purpose of this Act is to protect consumers and particularly, seniors, from abusive financial services practices by adopting model regulations of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and to comply with the senior investor protections in section 989A of the federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.   In 2007, the legislature passed Act 257, Session Laws of Hawaii 2007, which established standards and procedures for insurers and insurance producers that make recommendations to consumers regarding the purchase or exchange of annuities.  Part I of this Act adopts the updated version of the NAIC Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation (March 2010).  Part II of this Act adopts the NAIC Model Regulation on the Use of Senior-Specific Certifications and Professional Designations in the Sale of Life Insurance and Annuities.  Part II is intended to protect seniors against producers who misrepresent their level of expertise and credentials during the marketing and sales of life insurance and annuity products.
PART I
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 431, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding to part VII of article 10D a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§431:10D-A  Insurance producer training.  (a)  An insurance producer shall not solicit the sale of an annuity product unless the insurance producer has adequate knowledge of the product to recommend the annuity and the insurance producer is in compliance with the insurer's standards for product training.  An insurance producer may rely on insurer-provided product-specific training standards and materials to comply with this subsection. 
     (b)  Any insurance producer who is authorized to sell life or accident and health or sickness insurance and who engages in the sale of annuity products shall complete by January 31, 2012, a one-time training course approved by the commissioner and conducted by a valid continuing education course provider.  Any insurance producer who obtains a life insurance line of authority after January 31, 2012, may not engage in the sale of annuities until the requirements of this subsection have been met:  
     (1)  The minimum length of training required under this subsection shall be sufficient to qualify for at least four continuing education credits;
     (2)  The training required under this subsection shall include information on the following topics:
         (A)  The types of annuities and various classifications of annuities;
         (B)  Identification of the parties to an annuity;
         (C)  How fixed, variable, and indexed annuity contract provisions affect consumers;
         (D)  The application of income taxation to qualified and non-qualified annuities;
         (E)  The primary uses of annuities; and
         (F)  Appropriate sales practices, replacement, and disclosure requirements; and
     (3)  A course provider shall not present any marketing information or provide training on sales techniques or provide specific information about a particular insurer's products.  
     (c)  An insurer shall verify that an insurance producer has completed the annuity training course required under this section before allowing the producer to sell an annuity product for the insurer.  An insurer may satisfy its responsibility under this section by obtaining certificates of completion of the training course or by obtaining reports provided by commissioner-sponsored database systems or vendors, or from a reasonably reliable commercial database vendor that has a reporting arrangement with approved insurance continuing education providers."

     (1)  Truthfully responding to an insurer's request for confirmation of suitability information;
     (2)  Filing a complaint; or
     (3)  Cooperating with the investigation of a complaint.

PART II
     SECTION 7.  Chapter 431, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding to article 10D a new part to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
"PART
USE OF SENIOR-SPECIFIC DESIGNATIONS
AND PROFESSIONAL DESIGNATIONS
     §431:10D-B  Purpose.  The purpose of this part is to protect consumers from misleading and fraudulent marketing practices with respect to the use of senior-specific certifications and professional designations in the solicitation, sale, or purchase of, or advice made in connection with, a life insurance or annuity product.
     §431:10D-C  Prohibited uses of senior-specific certifications and professional designations.  (a)  It is an unfair and deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance within the meaning of article 13 for an insurance producer to use a senior-specific certification or professional designation that indicates or implies in such a way as to mislead a purchaser or prospective purchaser that the insurance producer has a special certification or training in advising or servicing seniors in connection with the solicitation, sale, or purchase of a life insurance or annuity product or in providing  advice as to the value of or the advisability of purchasing or selling a life insurance or annuity product, either directly or indirectly through publications or writings, or by issuing or promulgating analyses or reports related to a life insurance or annuity product. 
(b)  The prohibited use of senior-specific certifications or professional designations includes the following:
     (1)  Use of a certification or professional designation by an insurance producer who has not actually earned or is otherwise ineligible to use the certification or designation;
     (2)  Use of a non-existent, false, or self-conferred certification or professional designation;
     (3)  Use of a certification or professional designation that indicates or implies a level of occupational qualifications obtained through education, training, or experience that the insurance producer using the certification or designation does not have; and
     (4)  Use of a certification or professional designation that was obtained from a certifying or designating organization that:
         (A)  Is primarily engaged in the business of instruction in sales or marketing;
         (B)  Does not have reasonable standards or procedures for assuring the competency of its certificants or designees;
         (C)  Does not have reasonable standards or procedures for monitoring and disciplining its certificants or designees for improper or unethical conduct; or
         (D)  Does not have reasonable continuing education requirements for its certificants or designees to maintain the certificate or designation.
     (c)  There is a rebuttable presumption that a certifying or designating organization is not disqualified solely for purposes of subsection (b) when the certification or designation issued from the organization does not primarily apply to sales or marketing and when the organization or the certification or designation in question has been accredited by:
     (1)  The American National Standards Institute;
     (2)  The National Commission for Certifying Agencies; or
     (3)  Any organization that is on the United States Department of Education's list entitled "Accrediting Agencies Recognized for Title IV Purposes."
     (d)  In determining whether a combination of words or an acronym standing for a combination of words constitutes a certification or professional designation indicating or implying that a person has special certification or training in advising or servicing seniors, factors to be considered shall include:
     (1)  Use of one or more words such as "senior", "retirement", "elder", or like words combined with one or more words such as "certified", "registered", “chartered", "adviser", "specialist", "consultant", "planner", or like words, in the name of the certification or professional designation; and
     (2)  The manner in which those words are combined.
     (e)  For purposes of this section, a job title within an organization that is licensed or registered by a state or federal financial services regulatory agency is not a certification or professional designation, unless it is used in a manner that would confuse or mislead a reasonable consumer, when the job title:
     (1)  Indicates seniority or standing within the organization; or
     (2)  Specifies an individual's area of specialization within the organization."
PART III
     SECTION 8.  In codifying the new sections added by sections 2 and 7 of this Act, the revisor of statutes shall substitute appropriate section numbers for the letters used in designating the new sections in this Act.
SECTION 9.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 10.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
