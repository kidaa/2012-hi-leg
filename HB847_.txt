     (b)  In an arbitration proceeding to determine the fair market value, fair market rental or fair and reasonable rent of real property where the arbitrator is a real estate appraiser licensed under chapter 466K, the record of an award shall include but not be limited to findings of fact, the appraiser's rationale for the award, and information regarding the evidence that, including the data, methodologies, and analysis, provided the basis for the award.
