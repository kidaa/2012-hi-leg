A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE STATE COMMISSION ON FATHERHOOD.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature established the state commission on fatherhood in 2003 in recognition of the important and unique role fathers play in the lives of their children, families, and communities.  Act 156, Session Laws of Hawaii 2003, as amended by Act 148, Session Laws of Hawaii 2005, as amended by Act 232, Session Laws of Hawaii 2006, and as amended by Act 190, Session Laws of Hawaii 2007, directs the commission to serve in an advisory capacity to state agencies to promote healthy family relationships between parents and children.  In recognition of the commission's value and the need to continue to promote and support healthy families in Hawaii, the legislature established the commission as a permanent entity in 2007.
     The legislature finds that the term of office of the members of the state commission on fatherhood should be extended from two years to four years to provide for institutional knowledge and continuity.
     SECTION 2.  Section 577E-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:
     "(c)  All members shall serve for a term of [two] four years.  Any vacancies occurring in the membership of the commission shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term in the same manner as the original appointments.  No member shall serve on the commission for more than two terms; provided that if a member fills a vacancy and serves for the remainder of an unexpired term, that member shall be considered to have served one term."
     SECTION 3.  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, including section 26-34, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the term of any person currently serving as a member of the state commission on fatherhood on the day prior to the effective date of this Act shall be deemed to be one term with respect to the two-term limitation in subsection 577E-3(c), Hawaii Revised Statutes.
     SECTION 4.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect upon approval.
