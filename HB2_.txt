STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE HONOR AND REMEMBER FLAG.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  While war deaths have been a part of the United States' heritage since its birth, the State of Hawaii has not instituted an official symbol commemorating fallen servicepersons.  House Resolution 1034 of the 111th Congress designates the Honor and Remember Flag, created by Honor and Remember, Inc., to officially recognize and honor fallen members of the armed forces.
     The purpose of this Act is to designate the Honor and Remember Flag as a symbol for the State of Hawaii to officially recognize and honor fallen members of the armed forces.  The Honor and Remember Flag red field represents the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives for freedom.  The blue star is a symbol of active service in military conflict that dates back to World War I.  The white border recognizes the purity of the sacrifice.  The Honor and Remember Flag gold star signifies the ultimate sacrifice of a warrior in active service who is not returning home and reflects the value of the life given.  The Honor and Remember Flag flame symbolizes the eternal spirit of the departed.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§5      Honor and remember flag.  The honor and remember flag is adopted, established, and designated as the State's emblem of service and sacrifice by the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces who have given their lives in the line of duty."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
