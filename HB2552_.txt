A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO FUNDING FOR PARKING FOR DISABLED PERSONS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The Legislature finds that the statewide parking program for persons with disabilities, as established under part III of chapter 291, Hawaii Revised Statutes pursuant to the federal Uniform System for Handicapped Parking Act, and administered by the disability and communication access board, provides individuals with mobility disabilities the ability to travel and park in accessible parking stalls.  The purpose of this Act is to fund the disabled person parking program with revenues from a portion of the motor vehicle registration fee.
     SECTION 2.  Section 249-31, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§249-31  State registration fee.  (a)  All vehicles and motor vehicles in the State as defined in section 249-1, including antique motor vehicles, except as otherwise provided in sections 249-4 and 249-6, shall be subject to a [$45] $46 annual vehicle registration fee.  The fee shall be paid each year together with all other taxes and fees levied by this chapter on a staggered basis as established by each county as authorized by section 286-51, and the state registration for that county shall likewise be staggered so that the state registration fee is due and payable at the same time and shall be collected together with the county fee.  The state registration fee shall be deemed delinquent if not paid with the county registration fee.  The respective counties shall collect this fee together with the vehicle registration tax collected for the county and shall transfer the moneys collected under this section to the State.
     (b)  From each annual motor vehicle registration fee, the director shall deposit $40 into the state highway fund [and], $5 into the emergency medical services special fund[.], and $1 into the disability and communication access board special fund established pursuant to section 348F-7."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2013.
