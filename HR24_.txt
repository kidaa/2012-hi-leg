TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU TO STUDY THE ISSUE OF FRATERNITY AND SORORITY HOUSE LOCATIONS.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, apparently, some homes near the University of Hawaii--Manoa campus are rented to fraternities; and
 
     WHEREAS, at times, the residents of the fraternity homes hold noisy parties late into the night or early morning; and
 
     WHEREAS, the neighbors are extremely inconvenienced, and the enjoyment of their own homes is greatly compromised; and
 
     WHEREAS, complaints to the police are made, and warnings are issued, but immediate resolution of the noise problems do not generally result; and
 
     WHEREAS, a permanent solution to the problem may require drastic action, such as prohibiting locating fraternity and sorority houses and single-family homes in the same residential area; and
 
     WHEREAS, on Oahu, the City and County of Honolulu is primarily responsible for establishing and enforcing the zoning code; and
 
     WHEREAS, thus, the City and County should review whether it is appropriate to restrict the areas where fraternity and sorority houses may be located; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Department of Planning and Permitting (Department) of the City and County of Honolulu is requested to study whether the county land use ordinance may be used to restrict the location of fraternity and sorority houses on the island of Oahu; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department is requested to consider, but not be limited to, the following issues:
 
     (1) Whether a clear and enforceable definition of "fraternity or sorority house" may be developed; and
 
     (2) Whether:
 
          (A)  Prohibiting a fraternity or sorority house as a permitted use outside of a one-half mile radius from the University of Hawaii--Manoa campus would be appropriate and legal;
 
          (B)  Designating a fraternity or sorority house as a permitted use only in an apartment or apartment mixed use district would be a better alternative; or
 
(3)  Whether, as an alternative to defining "fraternity or sorority house," amending state statute or county ordinance to tighten restrictions on the maximum number of unrelated college students is preferable and feasible; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that when receiving an initial complaint of excessive noise at a fraternity or sorority house on a particular night and then finding the complaint to be valid, the Honolulu Police Department is requested to consider immediately issuing a citation, rather than a warning, to the fraternity or sorority house; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Mayor, the Director of Planning and Permitting, and the Chief of Police of the City and County of Honolulu.
