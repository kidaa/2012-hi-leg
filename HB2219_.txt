TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:



SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the department of education receives nearly a quarter of the State's entire operating budget, the largest amount of any state agency. The legislature also finds that current technologies can allow Internet access to fiscal information that provides the public with regular updates on how the department is utilizing its funds and facilitate increased transparency in the budgeting process.
The purpose of this Act is to require that the department of education develop and post a monthly report on the World Wide Web that shows revenues, expenditures, and cash on hand in sufficient detail to allow an accurate assessment of the fiscal condition and the performance of the department.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 37, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§37-     Department of education; online reporting; monthly updates.  (a)  Not later than January 1, 2013, the department of education, in accordance with this section, shall establish, implement, and maintain a single searchable website, updated on a monthly basis, accessible by the public at no cost to users, that includes but is not limited to:
(1)  A chart of accounts for all general funds, special funds, federal funds, interdepartmental transfers, revolving funds, and other funds into which monies are deposited for the operations of the department;
(2)  The appropriated and allocated amounts for each account, and expenditures to date, with explicit explanations of any anomalies and anticipated variances in each account; and
(3)  A monthly summary of income received, expenditures made, balances remaining, costs incurred but not yet expended, cash on hand, and any related information that may assist the legislature and members of the public in understanding the fiscal condition of the department.
     (b)  The department is authorized to designate one or more state agencies to participate in the development, establishment, maintenance, and support of the website.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2013.
