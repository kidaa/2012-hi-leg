     SECTION 1.  The purpose of this Act is to allow the department of health to designate an entity to perform services on its behalf relating to background checks for employment, volunteer, contracting, licensure, or certification purposes.
     SECTION 2.  Section 321-15.2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) to read as follows:
     "(b)  The department shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to ensure the reputable and responsible character of all prospective applicants, operators, direct patient access employees, and adult volunteers of a healthcare facility, and, in the case of any healthcare facility operated in a private residence, all adults living in the home other than the clients. These rules, among other things, shall specify how the department or designee may conduct criminal history record checks in accordance with section 846-2.7.
     (c)  All applicants and prospective operators shall: 
     (1)  Be subject to criminal history record checks in accordance with section 846-2.7;
     (2)  Authorize the disclosure to the department or designee of criminal history record information;
     (3)  Sign a waiver form stating that the department or designee shall not be liable to the applicant or prospective operator; and
     (4)  Consent to be fingerprinted for the purpose of requesting criminal history record information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Hawaii criminal justice data center.
     (d)  All prospective direct patient access employees and adult volunteers of healthcare facilities and, in the case of any healthcare facility operated in a private residence, all adults living in the home other than the clients shall:
     (1)  Consent to be fingerprinted;
     (2)  Provide all necessary information for the purpose of enabling the department or designee to conduct the criminal history record checks; and
     (3)  Sign a waiver form stating that the department or designee shall not be liable to the employee or volunteer.
     (e)  The department or designee may request criminal history record information which includes Federal Bureau of Investigation data through the Hawaii criminal justice data center on all prospective applicants, operators, direct patient access employees, and adult volunteers of healthcare facilities.  In addition, in the case of any healthcare facility to be operated in a private residence, the department of health or designee may request criminal history record information which includes Federal Bureau of Investigation data through the Hawaii criminal justice data center for all adults residing in the home who are not clients.
     (f)  The department or designee shall make a name inquiry into the criminal history records or conduct criminal history record checks of all prospective applicants, operators, direct patient access employees, and adult volunteers at the healthcare facility, and, in the case of any healthcare facility operated in a private residence, all adults living in the home other than the clients.
     (g)  The department may revoke or suspend a current license, impose penalties or fines, or deny an application for a license under rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91 if the applicant, operator, employee, or adult volunteer at the healthcare facility or, in the case of any healthcare facility operated in a private residence, any adult living in the home other than the client, refuses to authorize the department or designee to conduct a criminal history record check, obtain criminal history record information for verification, or consent to be fingerprinted.  In addition, the department may revoke or suspend a current license, impose penalties or fines, or deny an application for a license if the applicant, operator, direct patient access employee, or adult volunteer at the healthcare facility, or, in the case of a healthcare facility operated in a private residence, any adult living in the home other than the client, has any disqualifying information.  The department may also revoke or suspend a current license, impose penalties or fines, or deny an application for a license if the department determines, based upon consideration of the criminal history information, that the applicant, operator, direct patient access employee, or adult volunteer at the healthcare facility, or, in the case of a healthcare facility operated in a private residence, any adult living in the home other than the client, is unsuitable to work or live in close proximity to the residents of the healthcare facility such that the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the healthcare facility could be at risk."
     SECTION 3.  Section 321-15.2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (j) and (k) to read as follows:
     "(j)  The department, or designee, in obtaining and relying upon the criminal history record checks, is presumed to be acting in good faith and shall be immune from civil liability for taking or recommending action based upon the criminal history record information.  The good faith presumption may be rebutted upon a showing by the person or entity of a lack of good faith, and proof by a preponderance of the evidence, that the department relied upon information or opinion that it knew was false or misleading.
     (k)  Any applicant or operator who receives information from the department or designee relating to a criminal history record check of a direct patient access employee or adult volunteer or, in the case of a healthcare facility operated in a private residence, an adult living in the home other than the clients, is presumed to be acting in good faith and shall be immune from civil liability for taking or recommending action based upon the department's recommendation or direction.  Nothing in this section shall affect rights, obligations, remedies, liabilities, or standards of proof under chapters 368 and 378.
     Criminal history record information shall be used exclusively by the department or designee for the sole purpose of determining whether an applicant, operator, direct patient access employee, or adult volunteer at a healthcare facility, or, in the case of a facility operated in a private residence, any adult living in the home other than the clients is suitable for working or living in close proximity to residents of a healthcare facility such that the health, safety, and welfare of the residents would not be at risk."
     SECTION 4.  Section 321-171.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:

     (1)  Be subject to criminal history record checks in accordance with section 846-2.7; and
     (2)  Provide to the department of health or designee written consent for the department or designee to obtain criminal history record information for verification.

     SECTION 5.  Section 321-171.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (d) to read as follows:

     (d)  Each existing provider or provider and all employees hired after the initial licensure or certification of the existing provider or provider shall be subject to criminal history record checks in accordance with section 846-2.7, and shall provide consent to the department or designee to obtain criminal history record information for verification.

     SECTION 7.  Section 333F-22, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (g) to read as follows:
     "(g)  The department may revoke a current license or certification or deny an application for a license or certification to operate an adult foster home or developmental disabilities domiciliary home under rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91 if the existing provider or employee of an existing provider, applicant, current or prospective employee of the applicant, provider, or new employee of the provider refuses to submit to the department or designee statements indicating criminal convictions, refuses to provide consent to the department or designee to conduct a criminal history record check or obtain other criminal history record information for verification, refuses to be fingerprinted, has been convicted of a crime other than a minor traffic violation involving a fine of $50 or less; or if the department or designee finds that the criminal history record of the existing provider or employee of an existing provider, applicant, current or prospective employee of the applicant, provider, or new employee of the provider indicates that the individual may pose a risk to the health, safety, or well-being of persons with developmental disabilities or mental retardation living in the home."
