A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that public disclosure of incomes of elected officials enhances public trust because the disclosure tends to reduce real and perceived conflicts of interest.
     The purpose of this Act is to require legislators to disclose any source of annual income derived from a single source that is $25,000 or more, or that represents twenty-five per cent or more of the total annual income received from all sources other than the legislative salaries, if that source has an interest in the outcome of legislation.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 84, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§84-    Additional requirements of disclosure; legislator.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, and in addition to requirements for disclosure for legislators pursuant to section 84-17, a legislator shall disclose every source of annual income derived from a single source that is $25,000 or more, or that represents an amount equal to twenty-five per cent or more of the legislator's total annual income from all sources, excluding legislative salary, if that source has an interest in the outcome of legislation."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
