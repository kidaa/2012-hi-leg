TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO NATIONAL ASSISTANCE DOG WEEK.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii has 227,000 citizens with disabilities.  These citizens, who need a service dog, wait approximately 3 – 5 years for a service dog.
     The legislature also finds that assistance dogs transform the lives of their human partners with physical and mental disabilities.  Assistance dogs serve as devoted companions, helpers, aides, best friends and close family members.  Assistance dogs include service dogs, guide dogs, hearing alert dogs and alert/seizure response dogs.
     The legislature also finds that recognizing these dogs, who benefit Hawai‘i's citizens with disabilities, will aid in raising awareness and educate the public about how these specially trained animals are aiding so many people in Hawai‘i and could benefit so many more of Hawai‘i's citizens.
     The purpose of this act is to designate the second week of August as National Assistance Dog Week.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 8, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§8-      National Assistance Dog Week.     The second week of August shall be known and designated "National Assistance Dog Week".  This week is not and shall not be construed as a state holiday."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
