TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HOMELESSNESS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that homelessness is a societal problem that has plagued Hawaii and the nation for many years.  Although great strides have been made in addressing the issue of homelessness, Hawaii has experienced an increase in the number of homeless persons.  Homelessness remains a complex issue involving coordination, planning, implementation, and funding among state and county agencies, non-profit entities, and the federal government.
     On June 22, 2010, the cabinet secretaries from the federal Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs joined the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness to unveil and submit to the President and Congress the nation's first comprehensive strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness.  The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness comprises nineteen federal agencies to coordinate the nation's housing, health, job, education, and human services and to create a national partnership between every level of government and the private sector to maximize the effectiveness of the federal government's response in addressing homelessness.
     Described by the federal government as the most far‑reaching and ambitious program in history to prevent and end homelessness, the strategic plan will strengthen existing programs and forge new partnerships.  Working together with Congress, state and local officials, faith-based and community organizations, and business and philanthropic leaders across the country, the plan will harness public and private resources to build on proven local level innovations.
     The legislature finds that Hawaii must have in place a mechanism similar to the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness to formulate and coordinate a unified plan to address homelessness on all counties and facilitate the acquisition of federal funding for homeless programs.  The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness recommends that the states establish such a state agency whether by legislative action or executive order, or both.
     The purpose of this Act is to establish the Hawaii interagency council on homelessness and to make an appropriation for its administrative expenses.
     SECTION 2.  There is established the Hawaii interagency council on homelessness, which shall be an advisory body exempt from section 26-34, Hawaii Revised Statutes.  The Hawaii interagency council on homelessness shall be under the department of human services for administrative purposes.  The director of human services shall serve as the ad hoc coordinator of the Hawaii interagency council on homelessness.  The members of the Hawaii interagency council on homelessness shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for expenses, including travel expenses, necessary for the performance of their duties.
     The Hawaii interagency council on homelessness shall be responsible for organizing its member entities to formulate and coordinate a unified plan to address homelessness on all counties and facilitate the acquisition of federal funding for homeless programs.
     SECTION 3.  The Hawaii interagency council on homelessness shall be composed of at least one representative from each of the following offices, departments, agencies, entities, service providers, or their successors, or types of service:
