TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO LOWER NATIONAL ENERGY COSTS BY APPROVING THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the United States relies largely on imported fossil fuels for its power needs; and
 
     WHEREAS, the rising gasoline and energy prices are now impacting families, individuals and businesses throughout our nation; and
 
     WHEREAS, the United States Congress recently did not approve an amendment to the Federal Highway Reauthorization bill that would have allowed the Keystone XL pipeline project to proceed and reduce energy costs; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Keystone XL project will create jobs and good wages in this difficult economic climate, and the pipeline has been projected to create 20,000 immediate jobs in the heartland of our country and up to 200,000 indirect jobs, and has the backing of such notable labor organizations as the AFL-CIO; and
 
     WHEREAS, environmental researchers have documented that pipeline projects can lower America’s carbon footprint by dramatically lowering by the thousands the number of trucks on America’s highways and can serve as an environmentally sound method for delivering supplies and liquid resources to most parts of our nation; and
 
     WHEREAS, alternate pipeline routes are available and should be utilized to avoid dangerous environmental impacts; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the President of the United States and the United States Congress are urged to wholeheartedly support and approve the Keystone XL pipeline project, that will place our country on a path of tapping into domestic resources in an environmentally and economically responsible manner; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be distributed to the President of the United States, Hawaii's Congressional Delegation, the Governor of the State of Hawaii, and the Director of the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism.
