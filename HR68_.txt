TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
RECOGNIZING HAWAIIAN NATIONALS AS A POPULATION RESIDING LAWFULLY IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.
 
 
 

WHEREAS, in 2011, the Legislature enacted Act 195, Session Laws of Hawaii 2011, recognizing Native Hawaiians as the indigenous people of Hawaii; and
 
WHEREAS, the State has on numerous occasions, and in official documents and statutes, including Act 195, Session Laws of Hawaii 2011, affirmed that beginning in 1893, the United States violated the sovereignty of the Hawaiian Kingdom when it colluded with insurgents to usurp the government of the Hawaiian Kingdom; and
 
WHEREAS, international law clearly confirms that the sovereignty of the Hawaiian Kingdom was never relinquished or extinguished and that the Hawaiian Kingdom is "in continuity"; and
 
WHEREAS, international law prohibits the coercive assignment or altering of a person's nationality and citizenship to a foreign state without the explicit free, prior, and informed consent of the person; and
 
WHEREAS, in section 19 of the Admission Act, the United States Congress affirmed that the Admission Act itself does not confer or terminate or otherwise change the nationality status of Hawaiians; and
 
WHEREAS, a sizeable part of the population of the Hawaiian Islands identify themselves as Hawaiian Nationals and lawfully reserve and assert their right to claim nationality (citizenship or subject-ship) in the Hawaiian Kingdom, a nation in continuity; and
 
WHEREAS, the rights to Hawaiian Nationality are conferred by natural birth and customary law and practice, whether lineally descended from Hawaiian Nationals, by birth within the physical boundaries of the Hawaiian Islands, or by a formal process of naturalization; and
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to Hawaiian Kingdom laws, international treaties and conventions, the Law of Nations, and all other standards relating to nationality, Hawaiian Nationals are citizens of the Hawaiian Kingdom, residing in their own country, the Hawaiian Islands, and are not citizens of the United States or "residents" of the "State of Hawaii"; and
 
WHEREAS, in addition, the term "Hawaiian National" is not synonymous with the term "Native Hawaiian", which was coined by the United States Congress to narrowly define Hawaiians according to aboriginal blood quantum; now, therefore,
 
BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that Hawaiian Nationals are hereby recognized as an authentic population residing lawfully in the Hawaiian Islands; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Hawaiian Nationals are recognized as the authentic heirs, beneficiaries, and body politic of the Hawaiian Kingdom, a nation in continuity; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the State commits to uphold the laws regarding nationality-based discrimination, and to encourage the courts and law enforcement agencies in the State to cease all nationality-based harassment and prosecution of Hawaiian Nationals; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Hawaiian Nationals, as an authentic body politic, have the right to organize and restore their national government of, by, and for the people of the Hawaiian Islands; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, the Attorney General, the Chief Justice, the Chiefs of Police of the respective counties, and the Prosecuting Attorneys of each county.
