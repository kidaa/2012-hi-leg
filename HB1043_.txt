TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE HAWAII HURRICANE RELIEF FUND.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Hawaii is facing one of the most challenging economic times it has ever faced and these economic conditions have necessitated difficult decisions by the State to balance an already precarious budget.  The reduction in force in state government has reduced services to the public and has also had an adverse effect on the efficiency and effectiveness of certain key operational areas.  Funding reductions have also impacted the State's ability to provide services to those who are most vulnerable to setbacks during this time of economic uncertainties as well as the State's ability to fuel and sustain an economic recovery.
     The State's options for balancing the budget have, for the most part, been exercised.  This has resulted in negatively impacting the ability of state agencies to sustain the delivery of core services to the public and to other state agencies.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate Hawaii hurricane relief fund moneys into the general fund to make funds available to balance the State's budget for fiscal year ______ and maintain the levels of programs determined to be essential for education, public health, and public welfare.
     SECTION 2.  Notwithstanding provisions of chapter 431P, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to the contrary, there is appropriated out of the Hawaii hurricane relief fund the sum of $__________ or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year _____ to be deposited into the general fund to balance the State's budget and maintain the levels of programs determined to be essential for education, public health, and public welfare.
     The sum appropriated under this section shall be expended by the department of budget and finance for the purpose of this section.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
