TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO TAXATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The purpose of this Act is to temporarily:
     (1)  Disallow the deduction for out-of-state traveling expenses incurred in the pursuit of a trade or business; and
     (2)  Prohibit a publicly held corporation from deducting more than $129,660 for employee remuneration in the taxable year beginning after December 31, 2010, and $143,748 in the taxable year beginning after December 31, 2011.
     The legislature prefers to pursue policies that promote the circulation of money within the State to revitalize the local economy, rather than indirectly subsidizing expenditures made outside the State.
     The legislature finds that establishing a ceiling on the amount that publicly held corporations may deduct for the remuneration of highly paid employees should result in additional tax revenues that may be used to fund essential public health, safety, and education services.  A ceiling of $129,660 for the taxable year beginning after December 31, 2010, and $143,748 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2011, is equivalent to the salary levels that the governor would be entitled to in those taxable years, which would be rational and appropriate ceiling amounts.
     SECTION 2.  Section 235-2.4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§235-2.4  Operation of certain Internal Revenue Code provisions; sections 63 to 530.  (a)  Section 63 (with respect to taxable income defined) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be operative for the purposes of this chapter, subject to the following:
