     (b)  Except with respect to an early withdrawal penalty on an investment permitted by this section, the amount of such penalty being mutually agreed upon at the time of acquisition of such investment, no investment permitted by this section shall require or may in the future require payments by the State, whether unilateral, reciprocal, or otherwise, including margin payments, or shall bear interest at a variable rate which causes or may cause the market price of such investment to fluctuate; provided that such limitations shall not apply to money market mutual funds that:
(1)  Invest solely in:
(A)  Direct and general obligations of the United States; or
(B)  Obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States, the payment of the principal and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States;

     (d)  The short-term investment pool shall be operated under contract with a private investment advisor, approved by the commissioner and advisory committee, in accordance with chapter 103D.
     (e)  The commissioner shall make available to prospective depositors detailed information on the short-term investment pool, similar to that information generally contained in a securities prospectus.  The commissioner shall also ensure that periodic statements of accounts and reports on holdings are provided to pool participants relative to their proportionate share of the pool.
