HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF TITLE IX, THE PATSY T. MINK EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN EDUCATION ACT.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, 2012 marks the 40th Anniversary of Title IX, the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, which provides that, "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance"; and
 
     WHEREAS, Title IX, enacted in 1972, has increased opportunities for women and girls not only in athletics, but also in access to higher education, professional and nontraditional fields of study, and employment; and
 
     WHEREAS, Title IX can and has been invoked to protect against sexual harassment and bullying related to sexual orientation and gender identity; and
 
     WHEREAS, largely as a result of Title IX, female participation and achievement in math, science, and other traditionally male dominated academic fields has increased, discrimination against girls and teachers who become pregnant has decreased, sexual harassment in schools has been made specifically illegal, standardized testing has become less biased against girls, and women's participation in college athletics has risen; and
 
     WHEREAS, substantial gains have been made to ensure equal opportunity for women and girls in higher education across the country, however, decades of court cases, startling statistics, and unsuccessful challenges to Title IX suggest that non-compliance with Title IX remains rampant across the United States and that Title IX remains under attack; and
     WHEREAS, although the leaps and bounds made by women and girls due to Title IX have been recognized, there remains work to be done and progress to be made toward furthering equality in education for women and girls; and
 
     WHEREAS, Title IX is just as necessary today as it was when it was originally enacted and our duty is to ensure that the doors to academia and the playing field remain open to all girls and women who choose to walk through them; and
 
WHEREAS, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of Title IX, the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, the House of Representatives takes great pride in honoring those who have dedicated their lives to increasing opportunities for women and girls in Hawaii; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that this body hereby recognizes the accomplishments and celebrates the 40th Anniversary of Title IX, the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, and commends Justice Sabrina McKenna, Marilyn Moniz-Kahoohanohano, Jennifer Rose, Jill Nunokawa, and Catherine Betts who have become exceptional role models and have dedicated their lives to increasing opportunities for women and girls in Hawaii.
