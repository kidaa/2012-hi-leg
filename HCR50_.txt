     WHEREAS, in September 1918, Dr. Syngman Rhee, who was elected president of the Republic of Korea in 1948, established the Korean Christian Institute in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Korean Christian Institute was a coeducational school for grades 1 through 8 and was first located at 3320 Waialae Avenue, the site of the old Aliiolani College, presently Aliiolani Elementary School, located at 1240 7th Avenue; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Korean Christian Institute was relocated in 1922 to the present Kalihi Elementary School site at 2471 Kula Kolea Drive; and
 
     WHEREAS, after producing almost 300 graduates, the Korean Christian Institute closed in 1947 and its twenty-four acre site was sold to a developer in 1950; and
 
     WHEREAS, subsequently, a singly family subdivision was developed and the developer named a street Kula (school) Kolea (Korea) in honor of the school that once existed at the site; and
 
     WHEREAS, funds from the sale of the school site became the seed money for establishing Inha University in Incheon, Korea; and
 
     WHEREAS, President Syngman Rhee, who lived in Hawaii for a quarter century from 1913 through 1945, wanted to remember Hawaii's Koreans by naming the school Inha for Incheon, the port city where Korean immigration started and Hawaii, where Koreans supported the independence movement to regain sovereignty of Korea from Japanese occupation; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is fitting to recognize both locations of the Korean Christian Institute, with bronze plaques; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Governor is requested to direct the placement of two plaques to be funded by the Korean community as follows:

     (2)  One plaque is to be placed at an appropriate site at the Waialae Avenue side of the playground of Aliiolani Elementary School and to read in English and Korean "Korean Christian Institute Site 1918 – 1922"; and
 
     (3)  One plaque is to be placed at an appropriate site at the front of the administration building at Kalihi Elementary School and to read in English and Korean "Korean Christian Institute Site 1922 – 1947"; and
