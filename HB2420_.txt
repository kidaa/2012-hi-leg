(1)  Twenty-five per cent of the projected qualified rehabilitation expenditures; or
     (2)  Thirty per cent of the projected qualified expenditures for rehabilitation plans; provided that:

     (d)  If the tax credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of credits over liability shall be refunded to the taxpayer, provided that no refunds or payment on account of the tax credits allowed by this section shall be made for amounts less than $1.
     (e)  All claims, including any amended claims, for tax credits under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.
     (f)  Qualified staff of the state historic preservation division shall develop standards and criteria for the approval of rehabilitation of certified historic structures for which the tax credit under this section is sought.  The standards and criteria shall take into account whether the rehabilitation of a certified historic structure will preserve the historic character of the building.

     (h)  The director of taxation shall prepare any forms that may be necessary to claim a credit under this section.  The director may also require the taxpayer to furnish information to ascertain the validity of the claim for credit made under this section and may adopt rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91.
     (i)  The aggregate amount of tax credits claimed for qualified rehabilitation projects shall not exceed $         per taxable year and the Hawaii historic places review board shall be required to monitor, and inform the department of taxation of, the annual projected tax credit amount.
     (j)  The state historic preservation division, in consultation with the department of taxation, on an annual basis, shall determine the type of information that is necessary to enable a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the outcomes of an application for the tax credit.
     Every taxpayer claiming a tax credit under this section, no later than the last day of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year in which qualified costs were expended, shall submit a written, certified statement to the Hawaii historic places review board.
     Any taxpayer failing to submit information to the state historic preservation division in the manner prescribed by the state historic preservation division prior to the last day of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year in which qualified costs were expended shall not be eligible to receive the tax credit, and any credit already claimed for the taxable year shall be recaptured in total.  The amount of the recaptured tax credit shall be added to the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year in which the recapture occurs.
     Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a statement submitted under this subsection shall be a public document.
     (k)  Recapture of a previously claimed credit shall be required from a taxpayer who received a tax credit under this section if any of the following occur:
     (1)  The projected qualified expenditures do not materialize;
     (2)  The qualified rehabilitation plans do not proceed in a timely manner and in accordance with the approved plans; or
     (3)  In the case of the thirty per cent credit under subsection (a)(2):
         (A)  Less than twenty per cent of the units are rental units that qualify as affordable housing; or
          (B)  Less than ten per cent of the units are individual homeownership units that qualify as affordable housing.
     (l)  The state historic preservation division, in consultation with the department of taxation, shall submit a report to the legislature evaluating the effectiveness of the tax credit no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session.  The report shall include but not be limited to findings and recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the tax credit in order to further encourage the rehabilitation of historic properties.
     (m)  For the purposes of this section:
     "Certified historic structure" means any structure that is:
     (1)  Listed individually in the Hawaii register of historic places or the national register of historic places; or

     "Qualified rehabilitation expenditures" means any costs incurred for the physical construction involved in the rehabilitation of a historic structure for mixed residential and nonresidential uses; provided that at least thirty per cent of the total square footage of the rehabilitation is placed into service for residential use.  Qualified rehabilitation expenditures shall not include:
     (1)  The taxpayer's personal labor:
     (2)  The cost of a new addition, except as required to comply with the applicable county building code or fire safety code; or
     (3)  Any non-construction cost, such as architectural fees, legal fees, or financing fees.
     "Qualified staff of the state historic preservation division" means a staff member who meets the National Park Service, Secretary of the Interior's standards for architectural historian or historic architect.
     "Rehabilitation plan" means any construction plans and specifications for the proposed rehabilitation of a historic structure in sufficient detail for evaluation of compliance with the standards and criteria developed by the state historic preservation division.
     "Substantial rehabilitation" means the qualified rehabilitation expenditures of a historic structure that exceed twenty-five per cent of the assessed value of the structure."
