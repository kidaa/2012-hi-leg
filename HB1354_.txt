A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO RECIPROCAL BENEFICIARIES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Chapter 572C, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding four new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§572C-      Rights upon death of reciprocal beneficiary.  The surviving party to a reciprocal beneficiary relationship, following the death of the other party, shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law as a married individual upon the death of the individual's husband or wife.
     §572C-      Retirement; beneficiary designation.  A party to a reciprocal beneficiary relationship shall be able to name his or her reciprocal beneficiary as the beneficiary of any pension, profit-sharing, retirement, or other employment-related benefit plan qualifying under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, to which the party is a participant or member.
     §572C-      Adoption of federal law.  To the extent that provisions of Hawaii law adopt, refer to, or rely upon, provisions of federal law that would cause reciprocal beneficiaries to be treated differently than spouses, reciprocal beneficiaries shall be treated under Hawaii law as if federal law recognized reciprocal beneficiaries in the same manner as spouses.
     §572C-      Group insurance; dependant coverage.  (a)  An insurer who offers group health insurance that includes hospital, medical, or surgical expense benefits for employers shall provide equal coverage, under the same terms and conditions, to the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary of an employee, insured, or policyholder, and shall inform employers of this coverage.  A policy may not offer or provide coverage for the reciprocal beneficiary of an employee, insured, or policyholder that is not equal to the coverage provided to the spouse of an employee, insured, or policyholder.
     (b)  An employer who offers insurance coverage for the spouses of employees shall offer equal insurance coverage to the reciprocal beneficiary of employees as provided in subsection (a).
     (c)  The insurer of a policy for group health insurance for an employer may require that the employee, insured, or policyholder party to a reciprocal beneficiary relationship verify the status of the reciprocal beneficiary relationship by providing to the insurer a copy of a valid declaration of reciprocal beneficiary relationship filed with the director of health pursuant to section 572C-5 or an equivalent document issued by an authorized agency of another state under which the reciprocal beneficiary relationship was created, and may also require that the employee, insured, or policyholder party to a reciprocal beneficiary relationship notify the insurer upon the termination of the reciprocal beneficiary relationship; provided that an insurer may only require such information if it also requests the same from an employee, insured, or policyholder whose spouse is provided coverage.
     (d)  A group health insurance policy subject to the provisions of this section that is issued, amended, delivered, or renewed within the State after December 31, 2010, shall provide the same coverage to a reciprocal beneficiary as to a spouse of an employee, insured , or policyholder. 
     (e)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to expand the requirements of Title 26 United States Code Section 4980B, Title 29 United States Code Section 1161, Title 42 United States Code Section 300bb-1, or the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as these provisions are or may later be amended."
     SECTION 2.  Sections 76-103, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
 amended to read as follows:
     "§76-103 Veteran's preference.  The extent to which veteran's preference shall be given to veterans, to disabled veterans, to spouses of disabled veterans, to reciprocal beneficiaries of disabled veterans, [and] to surviving spouses of deceased [servicemen] service members who have not remarried, and to surviving reciprocal beneficiaries of deceased service members who have not entered into a subsequent marriage or reciprocal beneficiary relationship, shall be provided by rules [and regulations.]; provided that a surviving spouse and reciprocal beneficiary of a service member shall have the same preference."

For the purposes of this section and section 235-53, a return of a surviving spouse, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, or a surviving reciprocal beneficiary shall be treated as a joint return of a husband and wife or the parties to a reciprocal beneficiary relationship under section 235-93."

In that case the tax shall be computed on their aggregate income as provided in section 235-52, and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.  For purposes of this chapter "aggregate income" means the income of both spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries without regard to source [in the State].

the taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse[,] or reciprocal beneficiary, an election thereafter to make a joint return for the taxable year shall be made only upon compliance with rules of the department of taxation, which may limit the election and prescribe the terms and provisions applicable in such cases as nearly as may be in conformity with the Internal Revenue Code."
