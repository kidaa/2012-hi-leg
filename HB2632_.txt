     (b)  The lieutenant governor, with the approval of the governor, may designate some other officer of the government of the State to authenticate documents on behalf of the lieutenant governor during the lieutenant governor's temporary absence outside the State or during the lieutenant governor's illness whenever the documents require the signature of the lieutenant governor.  The person shall affix the person's own signature to the document with the words, "for the lieutenant governor" following and the signature shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement of the lieutenant governor's signature on the document.  The designation and approval shall be in writing and shall be filed in the office of the governor and a copy thereof, certified by the governor, shall be filed with the public archives.  The person so designated shall serve without additional compensation and the lieutenant governor shall be responsible and liable on the lieutenant governor's official bond for all acts done by the person so designated in the performance of the duties on behalf of the lieutenant governor.
     (c)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the person to exercise and discharge the powers and duties of the office of the governor as provided by the first paragraph of [Article] article V, section 4, of the [Constitution of the State.] state constitution.  The person shall not be authorized to exercise any powers whenever a successor to the lieutenant governor assumes the duties of the lieutenant governor pursuant to [Article] article V, section 4, of the [Constitution.] state constitution.
     (d)  The office of the lieutenant governor may:
     (1)  Upon request, assist state agencies in drafting grant proposals and complying with the provisions of this chapter and federal law; and
