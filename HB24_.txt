A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII BUDGET.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The University of Hawaii shall prepare the proposed budget for the 2012-2013 fiscal year for submittal to the 2012 legislature in accordance with zero-based budgeting principles.  The budget-planning process may begin on July 1, 2011, and shall include the following:
     (1)  Identification and description of each program activity;
     (2)  Statement of objectives of each program activity and output;
     (3)  Evaluation and ranking of program activities on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, and allocation of resources to program activities accordingly; and
     (4)  Identification of effects of each funding level on personnel requirements.
     In preparing the proposed budget, zero-based budgeting principles shall be applied to all University of Hawaii programs, including system-wide and campus-level administration and services, all colleges and associated programs, and research programs.
     The term "zero-based budgeting" means a budgeting system that starts from "zero" each fiscal year.  Each budget item shall be justified on the basis of cost-benefit analysis, and assumes that no present commitment exists and that there is no balance carried forward.
     All information developed for zero-based budgeting for the proposed budget shall be made available to the auditor, director of finance, and the chairpersons of the fiscal committees of the senate and house of representatives.
     SECTION 2.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
