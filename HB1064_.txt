TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO CHILD PROTECTIVE ACT COURT PROCEEDINGS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  During the 2010 regular session, the legislature passed Senate Bill 2716, which was enacted as Act 135, Session Laws of Hawaii 2010, and codified as chapter 587A, Child Protective Act, Hawaii Revised Statutes.  Act 135 was a comprehensive update of chapter 587, the former Child Protective Act, Hawaii Revised Statutes, which was repealed.  The provisions of Act 135 ensure the State's compliance with federal Title IV-E requirements so that Hawaii remains eligible for approximately $40,000,000 in annual federal funding.  Subsequent to the enactment of chapter 587A, it has become necessary to clarify wording in the statute to further ensure consistency in practice and compliance with federal requirements.
     SECTION 2.  Section 587A-5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "[[]§587A-5[]]  Jurisdiction.  Pursuant to section 571-11(9), the court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in a child protective proceeding [concerning]:
     (1)  Concerning any child who is or was found within the state at the time specified facts and circumstances occurred, are discovered, or are reported to the department.  These facts and circumstances constitute the basis for the court's finding that the child's physical or psychological health or welfare is subject to imminent harm, has been harmed, or is subject to threatened harm by the acts or omissions of the child's family[.]; or
     (2)  Any prior proceeding under chapter 587, the former Child Protective Act."
     SECTION 3.  Section 587A-27, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a) The service plan shall provide:
     (1)  The specific steps necessary to facilitate the return of the child to a safe family home, if the proposed placement of the child is in foster care under foster custody.  These specific steps shall include treatment and services that will be provided, actions completed, specific measurable and behavioral changes that must be achieved, and responsibilities assumed;
     (2)  Whether an ohana conference will be conducted for [fact] family finding and family group decision making;
     (3)  The respective responsibilities of the child, the parents, legal guardian or custodian, the department, other family members, and treatment providers, and a description and expected outcomes of the services required to achieve the permanency goal;
     (4)  The required frequency and types of contact between the assigned social worker, the child, and the family;
     (5)  The time frames during which services will be provided, actions must be completed, and responsibilities must be discharged;
     (6)  Notice to the parents that their failure to substantially achieve the objectives described in the service plan within the time frames established may result in termination of their parental rights;
     (7)  Notice to the parents that if the child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the department for an aggregate of fifteen out of the most recent twenty-two months from the child's date of entry into foster care, the department is required to file a motion to set a termination of parental rights hearing, and the parents' failure to provide a safe family home within two years from the date when the child was first placed under foster custody by the court, may result in the parents' parental rights being terminated; and
     (8)  Any other terms and conditions that the court or the authorized agency deem necessary to the success of the service plan."
     SECTION 4.  Section 587A-28, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (e) to read as follows:
     "(e) If the court finds that the child's physical or psychological health or welfare has been harmed or is subject to threatened harm by the acts or omissions of the child's family, the court:
     (1)  Shall enter a finding that the court has jurisdiction pursuant to section 587A-5;
     (2)  Shall enter a finding regarding whether, before the child was placed in foster care, the department made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the child's family home;
     (3)  Shall enter orders:
         (A)  That the child be placed in foster custody if the court finds that the child's remaining in the family home is contrary to the welfare of the child and the child's parents are not willing and able to provide a safe family home for the child, even with the assistance of a service plan; or
         (B)  That the child be placed in family supervision if the court finds that the child's parents are willing and able to provide the child with a safe family home with the assistance of a service plan;
     (4)  Shall determine whether aggravated circumstances are present.
         (A)  If aggravated circumstances are present, the court shall:
              (i)  Conduct a permanency hearing within thirty days, and the department shall not be required to provide the child's parents with an interim service plan or interim visitation; and
             (ii)  Order the department to file, within sixty days after the court's finding that aggravated circumstances are present, a motion to [set the matter for a termination of parental rights hearing.] terminate parental rights unless the department has documented in the safe family home factors or other written report submitted to the court a compelling reason why it is not in the best interest of the child to file a motion.
         (B)  If aggravated circumstances are not present[,] or there is a compelling reason why it is not in the best interest of the child to file a motion to terminate parental rights, the court shall order that the department make reasonable efforts to reunify the child with the child's parents and order an appropriate service plan;
     (5)  Shall order reasonable supervised or unsupervised visits for the child and the child's family, including with the child's siblings, unless such visits are determined to be unsafe or detrimental to, and not in the best interests of, the child;

     (7)  Shall determine whether each party understands that unless the family is willing and able to provide the child with a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service plan, within the reasonable period of time specified in the service plan, their respective parental and custodial duties and rights shall be subject to termination;
     (8)  Shall determine the child's date of entry into foster care as defined in this chapter;
     (9)  Shall set a periodic review hearing to be conducted no later than six months after the date of entry into foster care and a permanency hearing to be held no later than twelve months after the date of entry into foster care;
    (10)  Shall set a status conference, as the court deems appropriate, to be conducted no later than ninety days after the return hearing; and
    (11)  May order that:
         (A)  Any party participate in, complete, be liable for, and make every good faith effort to arrange payment for such services or treatment as are authorized by law and that are determined to be in the child's best interests;

     (b)  At each periodic review hearing, the court shall review the status of the case to determine whether the child is receiving appropriate services and care, whether the case plan is being properly implemented, and whether the department's or authorized agency's activities are directed toward a permanent placement for the child.  At the hearing, the court shall:
     (1)  Determine whether the child is safe[;] and enter orders that:
         (A)  The child be placed in foster custody if the court finds that the child's remaining in the family home is contrary to the welfare of the child and the child's parents are not willing and able to provide a safe family home for the child, even with the assistance of a service plan;
         (B)  The child be placed in family supervision if the court finds that the child's parents are willing and able to provide the child with a safe family home with the assistance of a service plan; or
