A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO MEDICAID.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the term "medical institution" can be vague.  This is to clarify that a medical institution is any facility that includes the practice of medicine and also provides long-term care services at a nursing facility level of care.
The purpose of this Act is to define the term "medical institution" as being an institution created for the practice of medicine and also provides long-term care services at a nursing facility level of care.
SECTION 2.  Section 346-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows:
""Medical institution" means, for the purposes of dealing with Medicaid liens in this chapter, an institution created for the practice of medicine and also provides long-term care services at a nursing facility level of care."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
