     WHEREAS, the federal government through the White House Council on Environmental Quality, Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force is commencing an initiative to manage coastal marine  areas using a process called coastal and marine spatial planning; and
 
     WHEREAS, coastal marine areas are the boundaries of all of the Hawaiian Islands; and
 
     WHEREAS, the native Hawaiian community has the longest historical utilization of these coastal areas; and
 
     WHEREAS, the native Hawaiian community traditional access and gathering rights are being diminished, threatening traditional cultural practices; and
 
     WHEREAS, the interruption of long and continuous uses diminishes the rights of native Hawaiians and further prevents traditional cultural practitioners from participating in natural resources management; and
 
     WHEREAS, the current rules and regulations regarding coastal marine areas favor recreational and other uses over traditional cultural practices, interrupting long and continuous activity that is the test for traditional cultural rights and practices; and
 
     WHEREAS, the native Hawaiian community wishes to manage their coastal marine resources based upon the resources and practices prevalent in their areas, place-based management using traditional values and generational knowledge, the system of best practices for natural resources management in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, submerged lands underlying all of the navigable waters of the State are ceded lands and ceded lands are held in trust for the benefit of native Hawaiians under section 5(f) of the Admission Act (Public Law 86-3); and
 
     WHEREAS, rules and regulations that govern the use and disposition of these ceded lands and the natural resources on them are created without consultation or compensation to the native Hawaiian beneficiaries, leaving native Hawaiian communities without a voice or representation in the process; and
 
     WHEREAS, Kamehameha III divided the lands and natural resources in Hawaii between the crown, chiefs, and commoners (maka ‘ainana), and the crown and chiefs are no longer present, leaving the maka ‘ainana responsible for the disposition, protection, and health of these lands and resources; and
 
     WHEREAS, the maka ‘ainana cannot relinquish their responsibility to Hawaii, these lands, and their ancestors and must participate in the rules and regulations and the disposition of their trust; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the State of Hawaii, particularly the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, Department of Land and Natural Resources, and Department of Health, are urged to participate in the coastal and marine spatial planning initiative of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force; and
