TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
ENCOURAGING THE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ALLOW PUBLIC SCHOOL CAMPUSES THAT HAVE SMALLER STUDENT ENROLLMENTS TO BE USED FOR AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CENTERS, SENIOR CENTERS, AND OTHER KUPUNA-RELATED PROGRAMS TO MEET COMMUNITY NEEDS AND AVOID THE CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS.
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Board of Education and Department of Education are charged with determining whether certain public schools in the State should be closed or otherwise consolidated; and
 
     WHEREAS, the procedures for closure and consolidation of public schools require the Superintendent of Education to appoint a task force to study the possible consolidation and make a report and recommendation to the Board of Education; and
 
     WHEREAS, low student enrollment is often cited as a reason to close certain schools; and
 
     WHEREAS, rather than closing schools based upon low student enrollment, portions of these schools could be repurposed to serve the community in other ways; and
 
     WHEREAS, as Hawaii's population ages, the demand for senior services, senior centers, and related resources continues to grow; and
 
     WHEREAS, public schools being considered for closure could be used to support an increasingly aging population by allowing a portion of school facilities to be used for aging and disability resource centers, senior centers, and other kupuna-related programs; and
 
     WHEREAS, a flexible policy could be developed to allow school campuses to be used for aging and disability resource centers, senior centers, and other kupuna-related programs when student enrollment is low but would remain available for school-aged children should enrollment numbers increase overtime; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Board of Education and Department of Education are encouraged to consider allowing public school campuses with smaller student enrollments to be used for aging and disability resource centers, senior centers, and other kupuna-related programs to meet community needs and avoid the closure of schools; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board of Education and Department of Education are encouraged to consider a flexible policy that allows school campuses to be better utilized based on the changing demographics of the community; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board of Education and Department of Education are encouraged to consult with the Director of the Executive Office on Aging to determine the feasibility of using a portion of public school campuses for services and programs that benefit Hawaii's aging population; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Chairman of the Board of Education, Superintendent of Education, and Director of the Executive Office on Aging.
