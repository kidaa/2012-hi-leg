TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
MAKING GRANT-IN-AID APPROPRIATIONS TO THE COUNTIES TO FINANCE DROUGHT MITIGATION PROJECTS AND MEASURES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that a viable agriculture industry requires a steady, reliable supply of water.  However, drought conditions continue to adversely affect local farms and ranches, hampering their ability to produce quality products on a consistent basis throughout the year.
     The legislature believes that to address the harmful impact of droughts, mitigation measures in the Hawaii drought plan must be implemented.  The goal of the Hawaii drought plan is to develop coordinated emergency response mechanisms and to outline steps toward mitigating the effects of future droughts.  The Hawaii drought plan provides clear policies and directs responsible agencies to implement immediate, short-term, and long-term response measures to mitigate the impact of droughts.
     The legislature also finds that in 2004, county drought committees were formed for each of the four counties in Hawaii.  Each of the county drought committees developed a drought mitigation strategy for its respective county, emphasizing drought mitigation projects.  These county drought mitigation strategies represent the local needs and concerns of each county and are incorporated by reference into the Hawaii drought plan.
     The legislature further finds that to implement the Hawaii drought plan adequately, sufficient funding for the counties is necessary to address the many challenges that our agriculture industry faces in preparing for droughts.
     The purpose of this Act is to provide funding to pursue drought mitigation projects and measures in each county of the State.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $4,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for a grant-in-aid to the counties for agricultural drought mitigation plans, measures, and projects, to be allocated as follows:
     County of Hawaii             $
     County of Kauai              $
     County of Maui               $
     City and county of Honolulu  $
     Total                        $4,000,000
     The sums appropriated shall be expended by the appropriate agency of each of the counties of Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, and the city and county of Honolulu; provided that each county shall coordinate its drought mitigation activities with the department of land and natural resources.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
