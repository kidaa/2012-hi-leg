A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO FLOOD MITIGATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that flooding is a major problem for various parts of the state.  Flooding not only causes physical damage to structures, but also creates dangerous travel conditions that lead to road closures and potential loss of life.  One area that has been particularly vulnerable to flooding is the segment of Farrington Highway between Maili and Nanakuli.  Flooding due to heavy rains has been a recurring problem in this area, causing unsafe road conditions and road closures as recently as January of 2011.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds for flood mitigation efforts on Farrington highway between Maili and Nanakuli.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $    or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 for flood mitigation efforts on Farrington highway between Maili and Nanakuli.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of transportation for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
