TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO INVASIVE SPECIES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the brown tree snake is an invasive species and can damage the balance of the State's ecosystem, threaten native forest vertebrate species, precipitate power outages affecting private, commercial, and military activities, cause widespread loss of domestic birds and pets, and cause considerable emotional trauma to residents and visitors alike when invading human habitat.  The brown tree snake was responsible for devastating the majority of the native bird population in Guam, and due to the availability of prey and lack of predators in introduced habitats such as Guam, they have been known to grow to sizes larger than their normal one to two meters (3.3 to 6.6 feet) in length.  To minimize the incidents of accidental migration, trained dogs are used to search for, locate, and remove brown tree snakes prior to the departures of outbound military and commercial cargo and transportation vessels from the island.
     The legislature also finds that there is no dedicated source of funding for brown tree snake mitigation and the State is primarily reliant on funding from the Department of Interior-Office of Insular Affairs for alleviation efforts.  However, this funding is not solely dedicated to brown tree snake mitigating efforts; it must also be used to address other snake incursions.
     The purpose of this Act is to provide funding for dog detector inspector positions within the department of agriculture, to prevent brown tree snake infestation in the State.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $180,552 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 to fund one full-time equivalent dog detector inspector IV position (1.0 FTE) and two full-time equivalent dog detector III (2.0 FTE) positions to prevent brown tree snake infestation.
     SECTION 3.  The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of agriculture for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
