STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR PHARMACISTS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

SECTION 1.  Act 165, Session Laws of Hawaii 2004, established a requirement for continuing education for pharmacists.  The current definition of continuing education courses has led to confusion about what are approved courses.  The legislature finds that it is necessary to clarify what courses will be counted toward the continuing education requirement for pharmacists.
The purpose of this Act is to provide the clarification.
     SECTION 2.  Section 461-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending the definition of "continuing education courses" to read as follows:
     ""Continuing education courses" means courses approved by the [American College of Pharmaceutical] Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education [or continuing medical education courses that serve to improve patient safety and to maintain quality national standards in the prevention of medical errors]."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval and shall apply to license renewals for the licensing biennium beginning on January 1, 2014.
