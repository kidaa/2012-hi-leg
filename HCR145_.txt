RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF HAWAII AND THE HAWAII SISTER-STATE COMMISSION TO APPROVE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SISTER STATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE OF HAWAII AND THE PROVINCE OF BALI INDONESIA.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, a sister-state relationship between Hawaii and Bali would be mutually beneficial to the United States and Indonesia, and is consistent with the new US-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership; and
 
     WHEREAS, pursuant to the enactment of Act 150, Session Laws of Hawaii 2006 (Act 150), the Hawaii Sister State Committee was established within the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to advise the Governor and the Legislature on matters relating to sister state or province relations between the State of Hawaii and the states or provinces of foreign countries; and
 
WHEREAS, the Republic of Indonesia is the world's third largest democracy, with a population of over 225 million people, and is regarded as a world-renown destination for tourism and resort travel; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2011, the Bali Times reported that the Bali province attracted 2.57 million tourists, which is approximately one-third of the total number of 7.65 million foreign visitors that traveled to Indonesia; and
 
WHEREAS, similar to Hawaii, Bali's economy is heavily dependent on tourism, which is its single largest industry, followed by agriculture; and
 
     WHEREAS, the US-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership initiative was designed to strengthen relations between the two countries through enhanced cooperation on energy efficiency, the environment, health, science, technology, trade, and investment; and
 
WHEREAS, when the sister state relationship is combined with the needs and agendas from the U.S. State Department and U.S. Department of Commerce, the Export-Import Bank, World Bank, and USAID, Hawaii could create a Hawaii-based regional center for international finance and foreign policy in the Pacific-Asia region; and
 
WHEREAS, a sister state working relationship with Bali would, in turn, create sustainable jobs in areas associated with international finance and other commerce related industries; and
 
WHEREAS, these industries would employ economists, engineers, bankers, and other consultants that could help to build trade practices in the region; now, therefore
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Governor of the State of Hawaii is requested to assist Hawaii in becoming a more active participant in the dynamic, economic, and diplomatic activities in the Asia-Pacific region by authorizing the establishment of a sister state relationship between Hawaii and Bali; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States, the President of the Republic of Indonesia, the United States Secretary of State, the Governor of the State of Hawaii, the Governor of Bali, the Director of the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, the Indonesian Ambassador to the United States, the President of the East-West Center, the Hawaii-Indonesia Chamber of Commerce in Honolulu, USINDO in Washington DC and the American Chamber of Commerce in Jakarta, Indonesia.
