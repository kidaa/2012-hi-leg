HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY TO ENTER INTO A PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT FOR THE PLANNING, DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, TURNKEY, AND FINANCING OF A NEW MAUI REGIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY COMPLEX AT PUUNENE, MAUI.
 
 
 

WHEREAS, part of the mission of the Department of Public Safety is to ensure the safety of Hawaii's communities through the provision of correctional services with professionalism, integrity, and fairness; and
 
WHEREAS, the Legislature believes that returning incarcerated persons from the mainland is in the best interest of the State, as it serves the economic and social interests of Hawaii's citizens; and
 
WHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety currently operates the Maui Community Correctional Center situated on approximately seven acres of land in Wailuku, Maui; and
 
WHEREAS, the Maui Community Correctional Center's operations are in need of modernization and expansion to meet Maui's current correctional needs; and
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to section 353-16.36, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the Governor may enter into and execute contracts in the name of the State with any private entity to construct and then lease or purchase correctional facilities on public or private lands for the benefit of the State; and
 
WHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety is collaborating with the Department of Land and Natural Resources, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, and the County of Maui in the proposed development of a new Maui Regional Public Safety Complex at Puunene, Maui; and
 
WHEREAS, this relocation to Puunene, Maui would enable the Department of Public Safety to expand the present capacities of the Maui Community Correctional Center; and
 
WHEREAS, the Maui Regional Public Safety Complex at Puunene would replace the Maui Community Correctional Center to provide for the care and custody of two distinct correctional populations:
 
     (1)  Jail inmates, consisting of pre-trial detainees, sentenced misdemeanants, sentenced felony probationers, and probation violators committed by the Second Judicial Circuit; and
 
     (2)  Prison inmates originating from the Second Judicial Circuit and deemed eligible for re-entry programs, and parole violators; and
 
WHEREAS, the State is interested in promoting a public-private partnership to plan, design, construct, turnkey, and finance, as permitted under Chapter 37D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the Maui Regional Public Safety Complex at Puunene; and
 
WHEREAS, such financing agreements have been used by the State for other projects as an alternative mechanism through which much-needed public facilities may be constructed without having to provide the funding upfront; and
 
WHEREAS, during a time when the State must exercise economic prudence, such alternative financing methods should be encouraged, especially where those efforts will directly benefit the public, provide an economic stimulus to the local economy, and enable expedited construction; and
 
WHEREAS, a request for proposal to plan, design, construct, turnkey, and finance the development of the new facility is anticipated to be issued shortly; now, therefore,
 
BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-Sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Public Safety is encouraged to enter into a public-private partnership agreement for the planning, design, construction, turnkey, and financing of a new Maui Regional Public Safety Complex in the Puunene, Maui region; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature supports the construction of the correctional facility in Puunene and any future appropriations that may be necessary for the Department of Public Safety to meet any future payment obligations under the agreement; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Comptroller, Director of Finance, Director of Public Safety, Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, Attorney General, Chairperson of the Hawaiian Homes Commission, and the Mayor and County Council of the County of Maui.
