HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY TO DEVELOP A SIMPLIFIED REPORTING SYSTEM FOR VETERINARIANS TO COMPLY WITH PART VIII OF CHAPTER 329, HAWAII REVISED STATUTES, PERTAINING TO THE ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, part VIII of chapter 329, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the Controlled Substances Act, required the establishment of an electronic prescription accountability system within six months of June 18, 1996; and
 
     WHEREAS, as the agency designated to oversee and administer the collection of information under the electronic prescription accountability system, the Narcotics Enforcement Division of the Department of Public Safety has never required veterinarians to comply with the system until the Division provided written notification to veterinarians in 2011 that compulsory reporting would commence on January 31, 2012; and
 
     WHEREAS, veterinarians are concerned about the impact that compliance with the electronic prescription accountability system would have on their practices, fiscal and otherwise; and
 
     WHEREAS, it would be reasonable to allow veterinarians to use a simplified reporting system for drugs prescribed, given the different nature of veternarians' practice compared to that of pharmacies; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Public Safety is requested to develop a simplified version of the electronic prescription accountability system for veterinarians, no later than December 31, 2012; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Public Safety is requested to provide veterinarians a reasonable period of time after the Department has developed the simplified version of the electronic prescription accountability system and notified the veterinarians of the system, before being compelled to commence their reporting under the system; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Public Safety is requested to report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Director of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, and the President of the Executive Board of the Hawaii Veterinary Medical Association, no later than twenty days before the convening of the Regular Session of 2013, on the status of the progress made in developing and implementing the simplified version of the electronic prescription accountability system; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor; the Director of Public Safety; the Deputy Director of the Narcotics Enforcement Division of the Department of Public Safety; the Director of Commerce and Consumer Affairs; the President of the Executive Board of the Hawaii Veterinary Medical Association; and all licensed veterinarians in the State.
