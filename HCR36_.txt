HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE AUDITOR TO CONDUCT A FOLLOW-UP AUDIT OF THE MANAGEMENT OF STATE BOATING FACILITIES BY THE DIVISION OF BOATING AND OCEAN RECREATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, small boat harbors and boating facilities are part of the State's ocean recreation and coastal areas programs established in chapter 200, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and are managed by the Department of Land and Natural Resources' Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation (Boating Division); and
 
     WHEREAS, the proper operation and maintenance of small boat harbors allows the public to benefit from the State's natural marine resources by engaging in recreational boating, commercial and personal fishing, and maritime-related business operations; and
 
     WHEREAS, residents and visitors alike use boating facilities to participate in ocean-based activities, such as yacht races, canoe regattas, ocean swimming, and surfing and board sailing contests; and
 
     WHEREAS, inadequate management of state boating facilities has been a recurring problem, as cited in Auditor Report No. 01‑09, "Audit of the Management of State Boating Facilities by the Department of Land and Natural Resources"; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Auditor's report in 1993 and its follow-up report in 1998 also attest to the problem of inadequate management, which has changed little when further audits were conducted in 2001 and 2006; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Boating Division's mismanagement and neglect has resulted in boating facilities deteriorating to the point where their continued use threatens public safety; and
 
     WHEREAS, of all the State's small boat harbors, perhaps the best known is Ala Wai small boat harbor in Honolulu; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Ala Wai small boat harbor facilities, like many of the State's other small boat harbors, need major repairs; and
 
     WHEREAS, the 2001 Auditor's report also found that the Boating Division lacked adequate controls to ensure the accuracy and integrity of its financial affairs, such as determining the cost of operating its boating facilities; and
 
     WHEREAS, in response to the 2001 Auditor's report, the Legislature passed S.B. No. 755, which was enacted as Act 285, Session Laws of Hawaii 2001, and codified as section 200-19, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to allow for private financing of small boat harbor improvements by execution of a capital advancement contract between the Board of Land and Natural Resources and a private party; and
 
     WHEREAS, Act 259, Session Laws of Hawaii 2001, appropriated the sum of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2001-2002, and the sum of $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2002-2003, for repair and maintenance of small boat harbor facilities; and
 
     WHEREAS, Act 41, Session Laws of Hawaii 2004, appropriated the sum of $9,000,000 for fiscal year 2004-2005 for improvements at various existing boating facilities throughout the State and other berthing and shore facilities including boat ramps; and
 
     WHEREAS, Act 178, Session Laws of Hawaii 2005, appropriated the sum of $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2005-2006 for improvements at various boating facilities; and
 
     WHEREAS, Act 213, Session Laws of Hawaii 2007, appropriated the sum of $1,840,000 for fiscal biennium 2007-2009 for improvements at various boating facilities; and
 
     WHEREAS, the portion of Auditor Report No. 06-04, "Financial Audit of the Department of Land and Natural Resources", relating to the operation and management of the Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation, found that although some of the prior recommendations had been implemented, the absence of effective management oversight continues to plague the Boating Division; and
 
     WHEREAS, in spite of the Legislature's continued efforts to rectify the problem of repair, maintenance, and management of the small boat harbors, problems continue to persist; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Auditor is requested to conduct a follow-up audit to the 2001 Audit of the Management of State Boating Facilities by the Department of Land and Natural Resources (Report No. 01-09) and the portion of the 2006 Financial Audit of the Department of Land and Natural Resources (Report No. 06-04) relating to the Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation, particularly as it applies to the Ala Wai small boat harbor; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor is requested to report findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature not later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2012; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources and the Auditor.
