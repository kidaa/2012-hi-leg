TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO TAXATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that, each year approximately $1,000,000,000 is given away in tax dollars in the form of tax exemptions, deductions, and credits to certain segments of the community.  While many, if not all are for good reasons and programs, these tax "giveaways" are perpetual and require little or no legislative oversight.  This is an unfair system, considering core programs such as education, public safety, health care programs, including the medicare and medicaid programs, and others must face legislative scrutiny before receiving continued funding.
     The purpose of this Act is to establish a sunrise and sunset review of certain tax exemptions, deductions, and credits to require legislative review of these programs to ensure their fiscal integrity and provide good state fiscal policy.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 231, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§231-     Tax credits and exemptions; evaluation; report.  (a)  The department shall perform an evaluation of the tax credits or tax exemptions provided in title 14 and scheduled for repeal in section 3 of Act    , Session Laws of Hawaii 2011.
     (b)  The department shall report to the legislature on the evaluation required by this section no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the 2012 regular session.
     (c)  In evaluating the economic effects of the tax credits and tax exemptions provided in title 14 and scheduled for repeal in section 3 of Act    , Session Laws of Hawaii 2011, the department may:
     (1)  Contract with recognized technical experts knowledgeable in the field of economics;
     (2)  Establish a technical advisory group, which may include the department of labor and industrial relations, department of agriculture, department of commerce and consumer affairs, department of transportation, department of human services, and department of business, economic development, and tourism, to help identify and develop the data elements needed for the analyses; and
     (3)  Collect, process, and analyze data from federal, state, and local government sources.
     (d)  The data and economic analyses provided by the department in its report to the legislature shall provide information sufficient to allow the legislature to determine whether the tax credits and tax exemptions provided under title 14 are achieving their intended objectives, are consistent with public policies, and whether the credits and exemptions should be reenacted, modified, or permitted to expire.
     (e)  If the department recommends that a tax credit or tax exemption should be modified, it shall provide with its report to the legislature, and with the assistance from the departments listed in subsection (c)(2), proposed draft legislation that, upon enactment, would effect the recommended modifications.
     (f)  If the department recommends that the law establishing a tax credit or tax exemption should not be reenacted, it shall make appropriate recommendations, with assistance from the departments listed in subsection (c)(2), to improve the operation of the tax credit or tax exemption, including recommendations for appropriate restrictions to be placed on the tax credit or tax exemption."
