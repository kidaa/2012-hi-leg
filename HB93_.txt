BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Section 514B-106, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (e) and (f) to read as follows:
     "(e)  Not later than the termination of any period of developer control, the unit owners shall elect a board of at least three members; provided that [projects]:
     (1)  Except as provided in paragraph (3), projects created after May 18, 1984, with one hundred or more individual units, shall have an elected board of at least nine members unless the membership has amended the bylaws to reduce the number of directors; [and provided further that projects]
     (2)  Except as provided in paragraph (3), projects with more than one hundred individual units where at least seventy per cent of the unit owners do not reside at the project may amend the bylaws to reduce the board to as few as five members by the written consent of a majority of owners or the vote of a majority of a quorum at any annual meeting or special meeting called for that purpose[.]; and
     (3)  Projects with more than seventy-five individual units that include nonresidential units, and more than twenty-five individual owners shall have an elected board of at least nine members representing residential and nonresidential units on the board in proportion to the number of such units in the project; provided further that no more than three board members shall represent nonresidential units; provided further that this paragraph shall not apply to time share units.
The association may rely on its membership records in determining whether a unit is owner-occupied.  A decrease in the number of directors shall not deprive an incumbent director of any remaining term of office.
     (f)  At any regular or special meeting of the association, any member of the board may be removed and successors shall be elected for the remainder of the term to fill the vacancies thus created.  The removal and replacement shall be by a vote of a majority of the unit owners and[, otherwise,] cumulative voting shall not be permitted.  Otherwise, the removal and replacement shall be in accordance with all applicable requirements and procedures in the bylaws for the removal and replacement of directors and, if removal and replacement is to occur at a special meeting, section 514B‑121(b)."
     SECTION 2.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on the three hundred and sixty-fifth day after the day of its approval.
