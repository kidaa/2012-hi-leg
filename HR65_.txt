HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
RECOGNIZING AND COMMENDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF HAWAII FOR ITS UNWAVERING SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE OF HAWAII.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the people of Hawaii take great pride in recognizing and honoring the achievements and notable contributions of individuals and organizations, who through their extraordinary dedication and tireless efforts, significantly add to the well-being of the community; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 1914, inspired by her experience working with poor women who suffered and sometimes died due to frequent pregnancies and self-induced abortions, and the deterioration of her mother's health as a result of 18 pregnancies in 22 years, nurse Margaret Sanger began publishing a monthly newsletter called, The Woman Rebel, which contained valuable information on safe sex and reproduction and became the first step in Sanger's public activism for women's reproductive health; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 1916, with the help of her sister, Ethel Byrne, Margaret Sanger opened America's first family planning and birth control clinic in Brooklyn, New York, to offer counseling and birth control information and supplies to women in the poverty-stricken Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn; and
 
     WHEREAS, five years later in 1921, Margaret Sanger founded the American Birth Control League, which in 1942 became part of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, one of the first nonprofit organizations in the country; and
 
     WHEREAS, committed to bringing birth control information and contraceptive devices to women, Margaret Sanger was arrested, prosecuted, and jailed many times, but the resulting public outcries helped lead to changes in laws, giving doctors the right to give birth control advice and birth control devices to patients; and
     WHEREAS, since 1942, Planned Parenthood has grown to over 820 clinic locations in the United States, which provide primary and preventive healthcare, medically accurate sex education programs, and factual information to improve the sexual health of individuals and families, both nationally and internationally, and serve nearly five million women, men, and adolescents annually; and
 
     WHEREAS, Planned Parenthood of Hawaii was founded in 1966 by a dedicated group of doctors and nurses who saw a need on the islands for affordable and effective reproductive healthcare services; and
 
     WHEREAS, Planned Parenthood of Hawaii advocates for the protection of women’s reproductive rights through public policies that ensure access and funding for the operation and support of Planned Parenthood, Federal Title X and various state family planning programs, sexual education and teen pregnancy prevention programs, and human papillomavirus and cervical cancer screening and treatment; and
 
     WHEREAS, Planned Parenthood of Hawaii also provides a full spectrum of reproductive healthcare such as annual pelvic exams, pap tests, and breast exams, mid-life services including hormone-replacement therapy and counseling, screening for testicular cancer, low-cost birth control services and supplies, emergency contraception, pregnancy testing and counseling, medical and surgical abortion services and support, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and HIV testing and counseling at clinics on Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii island; and
 
     WHEREAS, Planned Parenthood of Hawaii members are committed to Margaret Sanger's vision of protecting the reproductive rights of women, and maintaining the good health of Hawaii's people; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that this body hereby recognizes and commends Planned Parenthood of Hawaii for its unwavering support of the people of Hawaii over the past 45 years, and extends its warmest aloha and best wishes for continued success in all future endeavors.
