   [(11)] (10) Disclosure of reports and records relating to child abuse or neglect to the extent allowed by rules adopted under section 350-1.4.
     (b)  Disclosure to any committee or legislative body (federal, state, or local) of any information that identifies by name and address any such applicant or recipient; and publication of lists or names of applicants and recipients shall be prohibited.
     (c)  The department shall promulgate and enforce such rules as may be necessary to prevent improper acquisition or use of confidential information.  Any information secured pursuant to this section by the officials or employees may be used in connection with their official duties or within the scope and course of their employment but not otherwise, and shall be kept in confidential records or files, which shall not be subject to any other law permitting inspection of government records.  The department and its agents shall determine whether or not such inspection is in connection with such official duties or within the scope and course of such employment.

     (g)  All reports concerning adult abuse or neglect, as well as all records of such reports, are confidential and any unauthorized disclosure of a report or record of a report shall be a violation.  The director of human services may adopt, amend, or repeal rules, pursuant to chapter 91, to provide for the confidentiality of reports and records and for the authorized disclosure of reports and records.
     (h)  The prohibition against divulging confidential information shall not apply to applicants, recipients, or their minor dependents concerning the use or disclosure of the contents of the applicant's, recipient's, or the applicant's or recipient's minor dependents' own applications or records, or information regarding any services received or investigations pending against them.  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, in adopting and enforcing such rules as may be necessary to prevent the improper acquisition, disclosure, or use of confidential information, the department may not prohibit applicants, recipients, or their minor dependents by rule, formal or informal policy, or otherwise from disclosing the contents of the applicant's, recipient's, or the applicant's or recipient's minor dependents' own applications or records, or information regarding any services received or investigations pending against them."
     SECTION 2.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
