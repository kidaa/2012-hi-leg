TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE AUDITOR.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the heads of legislative service agencies have experienced a recent salary decrease (as have legislators, the governor, lieutenant government, department directors, deputy department directors, justices, and judges).  The auditor's salary, however, has not been similarly reduced because of the provision amended by this Act.  The legislature finds that the auditor's salary should be subject to the same provisions as other legislative service agency heads.
     The purpose of this Act is to allow the diminishment of the auditor's salary during the auditor's term of office by general law applicable to all salaried officers of the State.  This Act makes the auditor's salary diminishment provision the same as that for the legislative reference bureau director and the ombudsman.  Both, like the auditor, head legislative service agencies.
     SECTION 2.  Section 23-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§23-3  Salary of the auditor and appropriations.  [The salary of the auditor shall be fixed by the legislature and shall not be diminished during the auditor's term of office.] (a)  Effective July 1, 2005, the salary of the auditor shall be the same as the salary of the director of health.
     The salary of the auditor shall not be diminished during the auditor's term of office, unless by general law applying to all salaried officers of the State.
     (b)  The funds for the support of the auditor's office shall be provided for in the act providing for the expenses of the legislature."
     SECTION 3.  The salary of the auditor serving on the effective date of this Act shall not be diminished during the remainder of auditor's term of office unless by general law applicable to all salaried officers of the State that is enacted concurrent with or after the effective date of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
