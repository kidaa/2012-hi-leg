SECTION 1.  The purpose of this Act is to ensure that Hawaii is consistent with the efforts of federal agencies to control health care-associated infections.  This Act also ensures that the department of health has access to health care-associated infection data reported by Hawaii's health care providers to the federal government.  In addition, this Act requires the Hawaii legislature to be updated on federal and state efforts to report health care-associated infections.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 321, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§321-    Health care-associated infection reporting.  (a)  Each health care facility in Hawaii that is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shall report information about health care-associated infections to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's national healthcare safety network, as specified in the rules of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
(b)  Health care facilities shall authorize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to allow the department to access health care-associated infection data reported by Hawaii's health care providers to the national healthcare safety network.
(c)  The department may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to require that health care-associated infections that are multidrug-resistant be reported to the department through the national healthcare safety network.  The rules shall specify which health care facilities are required to report those health care-associated infections that are multidrug-resistant through the national healthcare safety network, as well as the patient populations that are to be targeted in the reports.  The first year of reporting required under this subsection shall be a pilot test of the reporting system and shall not be reported or disclosed to the public.
(d)  The department shall preserve patient confidentiality.  The department shall not disclose to the public any patient level data obtained from any health care provider.
(e)  The department may issue reports to the public about health care-associated infections that aggregate data so that no individual patient can be identified.  The reports may identify individual health care facilities.  The reports shall utilize the methodology or any part of the methodology developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for national reporting of health care-associated infections.
(f)  Health care-associated infection information held by the department as a result of reporting under this part is not subject to subpoena, discovery, or introduction into evidence in any civil or criminal proceeding, except that health care-associated infection information otherwise available from other sources is not immune from subpoena, discovery, or introduction into evidence through those sources solely because they were provided as required by this section.
(g)  For the purposes of this section:
"Department" means the department of health.
"Health care facility" means any entity that falls within the definition of "health care facility" in section 323D-2."
     SECTION 3.  The department of health shall submit a report to the legislature providing an update on health care-associated infection reporting required under section 2 of this Act.  The report shall be submitted no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2012.
