STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DIRECTOR OF LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO IMPROVE AND ACCELERATE THE PROCESSING OF WORKER'S COMPENSATION CLAIMS.
 
 
 

                WHEREAS, the Hawaii workers' compensation law under Chapter 386, Hawaii Revised Statutes, provides wage loss compensation and medical care to employees for work-related injuries; and
 
     WHEREAS, workers' compensation claims are processed by the Disability Compensation Division of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations; and
 
     WHEREAS, there are concerns that health care providers may refuse to treat patients with work-related injuries because of the complex process and time-consuming paperwork for workers' compensation claims; and
 
     WHEREAS, injured workers may not receive treatment in a timely manner because of difficulties they may have in finding a health care provider that accepts workers' compensation cases; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii is at risk of losing health care providers to other states, in part, because workers' compensation claims are processed more expeditiously in other jurisdictions; and
 
     WHEREAS, an evaluation is needed to determine whether the Disability Compensation Division's processes adequately serve workers' compensation claimants and facilitate prompt reimbursements to health care providers; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations is requested to identify ways to improve and accelerate the processing of workers' compensation claims by the Disability Compensation Division of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations is requested to submit to the Legislature THE Director's findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor and Director of Labor and Industrial Relations.
