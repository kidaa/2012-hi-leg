     WHEREAS, the United States Constitution guarantees all United States citizens and permanent residents, fundamental rights including the freedom of religion, speech, assembly and privacy; protection from unreasonable searches and seizures; due process and equal protection; equality before the law and the presumption of innocence; access to counsel in judicial proceedings; and a fair and speedy public trial; and
 
     WHEREAS, sections 1021 and 1022 of the National Defense Authorization Act have been called a violation of constitutional principles and of the United States Bill of Rights; and
 
     WHEREAS, the National Defense Authorization Act affirms its strong opposition to terrorism at the expense of the fundamental civil rights and liberties of its people; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that this body affirms its strong opposition to the indefinite detention provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012; and
