     (2)  There existed probable cause to believe that the respondent operated the vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant; and
     (3)  The evidence proves by a preponderance that:
         (A)  The respondent operated the vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant; or
         (B)  The respondent operated the vehicle and refused to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test after being informed:
              (i)  That the person may refuse to submit to testing in compliance with section 291E-11; and
             (ii)  Of the sanctions of this part and then asked if the person still refuses to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test in compliance with the requirements of section 291E-15.
     [(f)  In addition to subsection (e), the director shall affirm the administrative revocation of the registration of any motor vehicle owned by or registered to the respondent only if the director determines that the respondent is a repeat intoxicated driver.  If the director affirms the administrative revocation pursuant to this subsection, the director shall order the respondent to surrender the number plates and motor vehicle registration of any motor vehicle owned by or registered to the respondent.  The director may destroy any number plates taken into custody.
     (g)] (f)  The respondent's prior alcohol and drug enforcement contacts shall be entered into evidence.
     [(h)] (g)  The sworn statements provided in section 291E-36 shall be admitted into evidence.  The director shall consider the sworn statements in the absence of the law enforcement officer or other person.  Upon written notice to the director, no later than five days prior to the hearing, that the respondent wishes to examine a law enforcement officer or other person who made a sworn statement, the director shall issue a subpoena for the officer or other person to appear at the hearing.  Personal service upon the law enforcement officer or other person who made a sworn statement shall be made no later than forty-eight hours prior to the hearing time.  If the officer or other person cannot appear, the officer or other person at the discretion of the director, may testify by telephone.
     [(i)] (h)  The hearing shall be recorded in a manner to be determined by the director.
     [(j)] (i)  The director's decision shall be rendered in writing and mailed to the respondent, or to the parent or guardian of the respondent if the respondent is under the age of eighteen, no later than five days after the hearing is concluded.  If the decision is to reverse the administrative revocation, the director shall return the respondent's license, [and if applicable, motor vehicle registration and any number plates taken into custody,] along with a certified statement that administrative revocation proceedings have been terminated.  If the decision sustains the administrative revocation, the director shall mail to the respondent a written decision indicating the duration of the administrative revocation and any other conditions or restrictions as may be imposed pursuant to section 291E‑41.
     [(k)] (j)  For good cause shown, the director may grant a continuance either of the commencement of the hearing or of a hearing that has already commenced.  If a continuance is granted at the request of the director, the director shall extend the validity of the temporary permit, [and temporary motor vehicle registration and temporary number plates if applicable,] unless otherwise prohibited, for a period not to exceed the period of the continuance.  If a continuance is granted at the request of the respondent, the director shall not extend the validity of the temporary permit[, or temporary motor vehicle registration and temporary number plates, if applicable].  For purposes of this section, a continuance means a delay in the commencement of the hearing or an interruption of a hearing that has commenced, other than for recesses during the day or at the end of the day or week.  The absence from the hearing of a law enforcement officer or other person, upon whom personal service of a subpoena has been made as set forth in subsection [(h),] (g), constitutes good cause for a continuance.
     [(l)  The director may grant a special motor vehicle registration, pursuant to section 291E-48, to a qualified household member or a co-owner of any motor vehicle upon determination that:
     (1)  The person is completely dependent on the motor vehicle for the necessities of life; and
     (2)  At the time of the application for a special motor vehicle registration, the respondent does not have a valid ignition interlock permit.
The special motor vehicle registration shall not be valid for use by the respondent.

provided that when more than one administrative revocation, suspension, or conviction arises out of the same arrest, it shall be counted as only one prior alcohol enforcement contact or drug enforcement contact, whichever revocation, suspension, or conviction occurs later.
     [(c)  Whenever a motor vehicle registration is revoked under this part, the director shall cause the revocation to be entered electronically into the motor vehicle registration file of the respondent.
     (d)] (c)  If a respondent has refused to be tested after being informed:

     [(f)] (e)  Alcohol and drug enforcement contacts that occurred prior to January 1, 2002, shall be counted in determining the administrative revocation period.
     [(g)] (f)  The requirement to provide proof of financial responsibility pursuant to section 287-20 shall not be based upon a revocation under subsection (b)(1)."
