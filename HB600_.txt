TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HEALTH COVERAGE FOR BRAIN INJURIES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that traumatic brain injury is damage to the brain caused by an external force.  Traumatic brain injury may produce a diminished or altered state of consciousness and may result in an impairment of cognitive abilities or physical functioning.
     The legislature also finds that traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability among children and young adults.  However, survivors of traumatic brain injury can lead full lives, thanks to lifesaving medical techniques and rehabilitation services.  However, survivors face a long rehabilitation process that may not be covered by certain health benefit plans.
     The purpose of this Act is to require insurers, hospital and medical services plans, and health maintenance organizations to provide coverage for survivors of brain injuries, including cognitive and neurocognitive therapy, neurobehavioral and neuropsychological testing or treatment, and necessary post-acute transition services or community reintegration activities.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 431, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to article 10A to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§431:10A-    Cognitive rehabilitation therapy; notice.  (a)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, each individual and group hospital or medical service plan, policy, contract, or agreement issued or renewed in this State after December 31, 2011, shall provide the following therapy and services, as a result of and related to an acquired brain injury, for the member and individuals covered under the individual and group hospital or medical service plan, policy, contract, or agreement:
     (1)  Cognitive rehabilitation therapy;
     (2)  Cognitive communication therapy;
     (3)  Neurocognitive therapy and rehabilitation;

     (6)  Remediation; and
     (7)  Any necessary post-acute transition services or community reintegration services.
     (b)  Coverage required under this section may be subject to deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, or annual or maximum payment limits that are consistent with deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and annual or maximum payment limits applicable to other similar coverage under the policy, contract, plan, or agreement.
     (c)  Every insurer shall provide notice to its policyholders regarding the coverage required by this section.  Notice shall be in writing and in literature or correspondence sent to policyholders beginning with calendar year 2011 along with any other mailing to policyholders, but in no case later than December 31, 2011."
     SECTION 3.  Chapter 432, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§432-    Cognitive rehabilitation therapy; notice.  (a)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, each individual and group hospital or medical service plan, policy, contract, or agreement issued or renewed in this State after December 31, 2011, shall provide the following therapy and services, as a result of and related to an acquired brain injury, for the member and individuals covered under the individual and group hospital or medical service plan, policy, contract or agreement:

     (c)  Every mutual benefit society shall provide notice to its members regarding the coverage required by this section.  Notice shall be in writing and in literature or correspondence sent to members beginning with calendar year 2011 along with any other mailing to members, but in no case later than December 31, 2011."
     SECTION 4.  Section 432D-23, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§432D-23  Required provisions and benefits.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, each policy, contract, plan, or agreement issued in the State after January 1, 1995, by health maintenance organizations pursuant to this chapter, shall include benefits provided in sections 431:10-212, 431:10A-115, 431:10A-115.5, 431:10A-116, 431:10A-116.5, 431:10A-116.6, 431:10A-119, 431:10A-120, 431:10A-121, 431:10A-122, 431:10A-125, 431:10A-126, and [431:10A-122,] 431:10A-  , and chapter 431M."
