RELATING TO ELECTRICITY RATES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Chapter 269, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§269-     Rates for electricity; agricultural use.  (a)  It is the policy of the State to promote the long-term viability of agriculture by establishing mechanisms that provide for preferential rates for electricity for agricultural activities.  The public utilities commission shall have the authority to establish preferential rates for electricity used for agricultural activities in a public utility's service area.
     (b)  Upon receipt of a bona fide request for preferential rates for electricity to be used for agricultural activities, and proof that the customer engages in agricultural activities, a public utility shall provide to the public utilities commission for approval proposed preferential rates for electricity to be used only for qualified agricultural activities.  All such rates approved by the public utilities commission shall be subsidized by the electricity rates charged to other customers of the public utility, if required, as determined by the public utilities commission.  In reviewing the proposed preferential rates, the public utilities commission, in consultation with the department of agriculture, may establish additional criteria to qualify bona fide agribusinesses for electricity used solely for agricultural activities.  For rate cases initiated pursuant to this section, the public utilities commission shall allow the recovery of any reasonable unamortized costs incurred by the public utility in its previous rate case; provided, however, upon full amortization of these costs, rates shall be adjusted accordingly."
     SECTION 2.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
