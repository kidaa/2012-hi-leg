         (C)  The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this State; or
     (2)  [The] This State is the state of residence of the child, or a party who is an individual[,] is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this State, and all of the parties who are individuals have filed [written] consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this State to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction [over the order.  However, if the issuing state is a foreign jurisdiction that has not enacted a law or established procedures substantially similar to the procedures under this chapter, the consent otherwise required of an individual residing in this State is not required for the tribunal to assume jurisdiction to modify the child support order].
     (b)  Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this State and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.
     (c)  A tribunal of this State may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state[.], including the duration of the obligation of support.  If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and same child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under section 576B-207 establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.
     (d)  In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support.  The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this State.
     [(d)] (e)  On issuance of an order by a tribunal of this State modifying a child support order issued in another state, [a] the tribunal of this State becomes the tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
     (f)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (e) and section 576B‑201(b), a tribunal of this State retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this State if:
     (1)  One party resides in another state; and
     (2)  The other party resides outside the United States.
     [[]§576B-612[]]  Recognition of order modified in another state.  [A] If a child support order issued by a tribunal of this State [shall recognize a modification of its earlier child support order] is modified by a tribunal of another state which assumed jurisdiction pursuant to [this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter and, upon request, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, shall:] the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, a tribunal of this State:
     (1)  [Enforce the] May enforce its order that was modified only as to [amounts] arrears and interest accruing before the modification;
    [(2)  Enforce only nonmodifiable aspects of that order;
     (3)  Provide other] (2) May provide appropriate relief [only] for violations of [that] its order which occurred before the effective date of the modification; and
[(4) Recognize] (3) Shall recognize the modifying order of the other state, upon registration, for the purpose of enforcement.
     [[]§576B-613[]]  Jurisdiction to modify child support order of another state when individual parties reside in this State.  (a)  If all of the parties who are individuals reside in this State and the child does not reside in the issuing state, a tribunal of this State has jurisdiction to enforce and to modify the issuing state's child support order in a proceeding to register that order.
     (b)  A tribunal of this State exercising jurisdiction under this section shall apply the provisions of Articles 1 and 2, this article, and the procedural and substantive law of this State to the proceeding for enforcement or modification.  Articles 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 shall not apply.
     [[]§576B-614[]]  Notice to issuing tribunal of modification.  Within thirty days after issuance of a modified child support order, the party obtaining the modification shall file a certified copy of the order with the issuing tribunal that had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the earlier order, and in each tribunal in which the party knows the earlier order has been registered.  A party who obtains the order and fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises.  The failure does not affect the validity or enforceability of the modified order of the new tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
PART IV.  REGISTRATION AND MODIFICATION
OF FOREIGN CHILD SUPPORT ORDER
     §576B-615  Jurisdiction to modify child support order of foreign country.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in section 576B‑711, if a foreign country lacks or refuses to exercise jurisdiction to modify its child support order pursuant to its laws, a tribunal of this State may assume jurisdiction to modify the child-support order and bind all individuals subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal whether the consent to modification of a child support order otherwise required of the individual pursuant to section 576B‑611 has been given or whether the individual seeking modification is a resident of this State or of the foreign country.
     (b)  An order issued by a tribunal of this State modifying a foreign child support order pursuant to this section is the controlling order.
     §576B-616  Procedure to register child support order of foreign country for modification.  A party or support enforcement agency seeking to modify, or to modify and enforce, a foreign child support order not under the Convention may register that order in this State under sections 576B‑601 through 576B-608 if the order has not been registered.  A petition for modification may be filed at the same time as a request for registration, or at another time.  The petition must specify the grounds for modification.

     (c)  If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand.  If the petitioner prevails and the individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the governor may decline to honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.
