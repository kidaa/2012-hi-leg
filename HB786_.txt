TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO SOLID WASTE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The purpose of this Act is to:
     (1)  Increase the solid waste management surcharge; and
     (2)  Extend the surcharge to solid waste shipped outside the State for disposal.
     The legislature finds that the surcharge increase is necessary to promote the public health.  Additional revenue is needed by the department of health for the operation of its environmental management program.  Furthermore, additional revenue would enable the legislature to reduce the general fund subsidy for the program.
     SECTION 2.  Section 342G-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows:
     ""Solid waste shipping facility" means any facility that receives and prepares solid waste for shipping and ultimate disposal outside the State."
     SECTION 3.  Section 342G-62, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  There is established a solid waste management surcharge.  The solid waste management surcharge shall be [35] 55 cents per ton of solid waste [disposed]:
     (1)  Disposed of within the State at permitted or unpermitted solid waste disposal facilities[.]; or
     (2)  Shipped out-of-state by solid waste shipping facilities.
The surcharge shall be paid by the person or entity doing the disposal[.] or shipping.  The owner or operator of the facility shall transfer all moneys collected from the surcharge to the department through a quarterly reporting and payment schedule.  Estimates of quarterly solid waste disposal shall be submitted prior to the first day of each quarter and the transfer of moneys collected shall occur within thirty days of the end of each quarter."
     SECTION 4.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
