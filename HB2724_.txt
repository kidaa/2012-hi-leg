TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO CORRECTIONS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that commissaries at state correctional facilities provide an opportunity for inmates to purchase goods for personal use, such as sundries, hygiene products, and food.  The prices of goods at the commissaries, however, are higher than those found in public retail stores.  The legislature is concerned that the markups at the commissaries may be excessive.
     The purpose of this Act is to require the auditor to conduct a financial and management audit of the operations of the department of public safety's commissaries, as well as the commissary operations of out-of-state contracted correctional facilities where Hawaii inmates are confined.
     SECTION 2.  The office of the auditor shall conduct a financial and management audit of the department of public safety's commissary operations, as well as the operations of the commissaries in out-of-state contracted correctional facilities where Hawaii inmates are confined, that shall include but not be limited to determining:
     (1)  The total annual revenues generated from the sales of commissary items during the prior fiscal year;
     (2)  The total annual expenditures incurred for the operation and maintenance of each commissary during the prior fiscal year;
     (3)  The criteria used to select the type of items that are stocked and made available at commissaries;
     (4)  The method used to determine the price of items sold to inmates at commissaries; and
     (5)  Any contractual agreement where a party other than the State operates the commissary to identify any controls on pricing and profits.
     SECTION 3.  The office of the auditor shall submit a report of its findings and any recommendations of the financial and management audit, including any proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2013.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
