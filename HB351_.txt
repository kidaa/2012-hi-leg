TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 132, S.D. 1 (2009), established a task force to determine the economic contributions of the construction industry in Hawaii and to develop a series of proposals for state actions to preserve and create new jobs in the local construction industry.  This Act implements one of the task force's proposals in conjunction with the Abercrombie administration's support for state actions to create new jobs in Hawaii's construction industry.
     In addition, in 2010, the senate committee on economic development and technology and the house committee on economic revitalization, business, and military affairs convened an informal small business discussion group to address the most critical issues facing the small business sectors within Hawaii's economy.  Representatives from the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii, construction and trades industries, community nonprofits, the agricultural sector, food and restaurant industries, retailing, the science and technology sector, the commercial transportation industry, and interested stakeholders developed a package of bills that address the most pressing problems facing Hawaii's small business community.
     The purpose of this Act is to support the findings of the small business working group and the recommendations proposed by the construction industry task force by amending chapter 103D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to require all state agencies to finalize contract certification with the department of accounting and general services within sixty days.
     SECTION 2.  Section 103D-318, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "[[]§103D-318[]]  Finality of determinations[.]; certification of contracts.  (a)  The determinations required by sections 103D-302(g), 103D-303(a), 103D-303(g), 103D-306, 103D‑307, 103D-310, 103D-312(c), 103D-313, and 103D-314 shall be final and conclusive unless they are clearly erroneous, arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.
     (b)  All state agencies shall finalize and certify contracts with the department of accounting and general services within sixty days of a contract being awarded."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.

     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
