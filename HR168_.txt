URGING THE PRESERVATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING IN THE PENTAGON BUDGET.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the defense industry plays a significant role in the growth of the state economy; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii is the home base for a significant number of United States military commands, including combat forces of all of the service branches, world-class testing and development sites, and the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard; and
 
     WHEREAS, these military assets provide a unique opportunity to aid in establishing an ecosystem essential to sustaining growth in innovation; and
 
     WHEREAS, fostering and encouraging innovation is essential to a comprehensive economic strategy for the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, research and development is the foundation of innovation; and
 
     WHEREAS, Pentagon budget proposals for fiscal year 2012 indicate a marked reduction in funding for research and development; and
 
     WHEREAS, preserving funding for research and development in the Pentagon budget would potentially provide needed stimulus and support to the state economy; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Obama Administration, the United States Congress, the United States Department of Defense, the Governor, and the Military Affairs Council of the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii are urged to do everything within their power and influence to preserve research and development funding in the Pentagon budget; and
