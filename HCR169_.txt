TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE COUNTIES TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT COMMUNITY CONCERNS COUNCILS IN RURAL AREAS.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that full and active participation by citizens is essential to a well-functioning democracy; and
 
     WHEREAS, the City and County of Honolulu, through the Neighborhood Commission, has successfully implemented its Neighborhood Board System using the concept of "participatory democracy"; and
 
     WHEREAS, the neighborhood boards provide a vehicle through which citizens are able to voice their concerns about public safety issues such as crime and traffic, proposed private or public development in a district, and upcoming events that may impact a district; and
 
     WHEREAS, while the Neighborhood Board System works well in a large urban area, such as the City and County of Honolulu, less-populated rural areas in the State may be better served by a different type of neighborhood citizenry group; and
 
     WHEREAS, a community concerns council made up of seven members elected by the community may be more feasible and accessible for a rural area with a population of ten thousand or less; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that encouraging counties to develop and implement community concerns councils to serve rural communities would improve opportunities for people in rural areas to actively participate in the affairs of their communities; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Legislature further finds that counties that develop and coordinate a system of community concerns councils, much like the City and County of Honolulu's Neighborhood Commission coordinates the neighborhood boards, would facilitate the citizen participation process; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the county councils are urged to develop and implement community concerns councils in their counties to serve rural communities within their respective jurisdictions with a population of ten thousand or less; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the mayors and councils of the counties of this State.
