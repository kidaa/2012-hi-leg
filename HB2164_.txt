TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that every effort must be made to ensure that more renewable energy is used in the State to lessen our dependence on expensive and environmentally harmful fossil fuels.  Currently, only fifteen per cent of an electric circuit demand may be supplied to an area circuit by homeowner and business distributed generation, including solar and wind power.  When an area circuit reaches the fifteen per cent threshold, homeowners and businesses that want to add distributed generation to the grid are not allowed to do so, which results in the use of more harmful fossil fuels and less renewable energy.  Such a restrictive cap on the use of distributed generation is paradoxical to the State's long asserted desire to increase the use of renewable energy.
The purpose of this Act is to require the public utilities commission to adopt rules to require that the area circuit threshold for distributed generation be no less than fifty per cent.
SECTION 2.  The public utilities commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to require that the area circuit threshold for distributed generation be no less than fifty per cent.
SECTION 3.  The chair of the public utilities commission shall submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2013 on the status of the rules required under section 2 of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
