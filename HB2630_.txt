TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO RENTAL AGREEMENTS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the existing forty-five-day written-notification requirement of termination of lease in the landlord-tenant code is extremely cumbersome for landlords of tenants who fail to abide by their rental agreement and do not pay their rent in a timely fashion.  Furthermore, this requirement places an onerous burden on landlords when no rental payment is provided for two months, particularly in cases in which these landlords may rely on these monthly payments to pay their bills, property taxes, insurance policies, and other expenses.
     The purpose of this Act is to modify the existing landlord-tenant code to reduce the written-notification requirement of termination of lease from forty-five days to thirty days, which equals the maximum number of days for which a tenant may be charged a security deposit.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 521-71, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  When the tenancy is month-to-month, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement by notifying the tenant, in writing, at least [forty-five] thirty days in advance of the anticipated termination.  When the landlord provides notification of termination, the tenant may vacate at any time within the last [forty-five] thirty days of the period between the notification and the termination date, but the tenant shall notify the landlord of the date the tenant will vacate the dwelling unit and shall pay a prorated rent for that period of occupation."
     SECTION 3.  This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date.
     SECTION 4.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
