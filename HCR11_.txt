HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TO INITIATE A PILOT PROJECT TO USE ALL ZIPPER LANES AS E-ZPASS TOLL COLLECTION ROADS DURING RUSH HOUR.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the poor condition of Hawaii's roads has been widely criticized in recent years; and
 
     WHEREAS, many of Hawaii's roads have fallen into a state of disrepair, thereby presenting a safety risk to children, kupuna, and all pedestrians, and causing anguish to drivers and damage to vehicles; and
 
     WHEREAS, generally, the cost associated with road repair and maintenance has increased in recent years while fuel tax revenues have decreased; and
 
     WHEREAS, a decrease in fuel tax revenues generally results in a decrease in appropriations to the state highway special fund which is used to effectuate necessary repair and maintenance of state roads; and
 
     WHEREAS, the E-ZPass toll system is an effective and efficient means to supplement fuel tax revenues in order to ensure that the State can afford necessary road repairs; and
 
     WHEREAS, E-ZPass is an electronic toll collection system which takes cash, coins, and toll tickets out of the toll collection process by allowing drivers to prepay tolls; and
 
WHEREAS, the E-ZPass toll system works by attaching a small electronic device to the vehicle of E-ZPass customers that allows the toll to be automatically calculated and deducted from a prepaid account as E-ZPass customers pass through the toll lanes; and
 
WHEREAS, in addition to increased revenues for the State, there are many other benefits of E-ZPass toll roads, including reduced traffic congestion, reduced harmful motor vehicle emissions, and increased fuel consumption for motorists; and
 
WHEREAS, the E-ZPass toll system could be most easily implemented on the currently designated zipper lanes; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Transportation is urged to initiate a pilot project to use all zipper lanes as E-ZPass toll collection roads during rush hour; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that any revenues collected pursuant to the pilot project be used for design, construction, and maintenance of public roads and highways, and not be deposited into and expended from the general fund for other purposes; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that any E-ZPass toll collection road be accessible to all drivers regardless of vehicle occupancy; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Transportation, the Director of Transportation Services, and the State Transportation Planner.
