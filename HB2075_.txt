TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO TAXATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the transfer of ownership of a business entity is comparable to the sale of an interest in real property held by the entity.  The legislature believes that all transfers of possession or use of real property should be subject to the same conveyance tax obligations.
     The purpose of this Act is to apply the conveyance tax to transfers of entity ownership when the transfer of entity ownership is essentially equivalent to the sale of an interest in real property.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 247, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§247-A  Transfer of a controlling interest; applicability.  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the tax imposed by section 247-1 shall apply to the transfer or conveyance of an interest in realty located in the State as a result of the transfer or acquisition, or a series of transfers or acquisitions, including those combined with otherwise exempt transfers, by any person or entity, acting alone or in concert, within any twelve-month period, that result in the transfer of a controlling interest in an entity with an interest in realty located in the State for valuable consideration which results in the transfer of control or ownership of the realty located in the State; provided that this section shall not apply to:
     (1)  Any transfer or acquisition that consists of the change in identity or form of ownership of an entity where there is no change in the beneficial ownership, including transfers to an entity wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the same common ownership as the transferor; or
     (2)  Any transfer from a limited partner to a general partner of a limited partnership that owns an affordable rental housing project for which low-income housing tax credits have been issued under section 235-110.8 or 241-4.7 or section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
     (b)  For the purpose of determining whether, pursuant to the exercise of an option, a controlling interest was transferred or acquired within a twelve-month period, the date that the option agreement was executed shall be the date upon which the transfer or acquisition of the controlling interest is deemed to occur.  For all other purposes under this chapter, the date upon which the option is exercised shall be the date of the transfer or acquisition of the controlling interest.
     (c)  For the purposes of this section with regard to persons acting in concert:
     (1)  All acquisitions of persons acting in concert shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining whether a transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest has taken place;
     (2)  Persons shall be considered as acting in concert when they have a relationship with each other such that one person influences or controls the actions of another through common ownership;
     (3)  Persons shall be considered to be acting in concert only when the unity with which the purchasers negotiate and consummate the transfer of ownership interests supports a finding that the persons are acting as a single entity; and
     (4)  If acquisitions are completely independent and each purchaser purchases without regard to the identity of the other purchasers, then the acquisitions shall be considered separate acquisitions.
     (d)  As used in this section, "controlling interest" means:
     (1)  In the case of a corporation, either fifty per cent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the corporation entitled to vote, or fifty per cent or more of the capital, profits, or beneficial interest in the voting stock of the corporation; and
     (2)  In the case of a partnership, association, trust, or other entity, fifty per cent or more of the capital, profits, or beneficial interest in the partnership, association, trust, or other entity.
     (e)  The director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to implement this section, including rules for determining:
     (1)  The value of the realty being transferred as the result of the transfer of a controlling interest; and
     (2)  Whether persons are acting in concert for the purpose of effectuating the transfer of a controlling interest.
     §247-B  Taxation at the lowest rate.  The tax imposed by section 247-1 shall apply to the following at the lowest rate provided in section 247-2(1), regardless of the value of the real property:
     (1)  Any document or instrument conveying real property, or any interest therein, from an entity that is a party to a merger or consolidation under chapter 414, 414D, 415A, 421, 421C, 425, 425E, or 428 to the surviving or new entity;
     (2)  Any document or instrument conveying real property, or any interest therein, from a dissolving limited partnership to its corporate general partner that owns, directly or indirectly, at least a ninety per cent interest in the partnership, determined by applying section 318 (with respect to constructive ownership of stock) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to the constructive ownership of interests in the partnership; and
     (3)  Any document or instrument conveying real property, or any interest therein, to or from a wholly-owned corporation or limited liability company."
     SECTION 3.  Section 247-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§247-1  Imposition of tax.  There is hereby imposed and shall be levied, collected, and paid, a tax as hereinafter provided, on all transfers or conveyances of realty located in the State or any interest therein[, by]:
     (1)  By way of deeds, leases, subleases, assignments of lease, agreements of sale, assignments of agreement of sale, instruments, writings, and any other document, whereby any lands, interests in land, tenements, or other realty sold shall be granted, assigned, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to, or vested in, the purchaser or purchasers, lessee or lessees, sublessee or sublessees, assignee or assignees, or any other person or persons, by the person's or their direction[.]; or
     (2)  By way of the transfer of a controlling interest as that term is used in section 247-A."
     SECTION 4.  Section 247-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§247-2  Basis and rate of tax.  The tax imposed by section 247-1 shall be based on the actual and full consideration (whether cash or otherwise, including any promise, act, forbearance, property interest, value, gain, advantage, benefit, or profit), paid or to be paid for all transfers or conveyance of realty located in the State or any interest therein, that shall include any liens or encumbrances thereon at the time of sale, lease, sublease, assignment, transfer, or conveyance, and shall be at the following rates:
