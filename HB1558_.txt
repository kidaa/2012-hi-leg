TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Hawaii has long been a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural society, blending diverse food, customs, and languages together to form a new whole.  However, this melting pot has yet to extend to foreign language education in the State's public elementary schools.
     The legislature finds that while foreign languages are offered in high school, there are several benefits to teaching children a foreign language beginning in kindergarten and continuing throughout a child's school career.  Research has shown a positive correlation between the study of a foreign language and increased cognitive and academic ability, leading to improved student performance indicators.  In addition, a multi-lingual workforce will enhance the State's economic stability, particularly as a "crossroads of the Pacific."
     The purpose of this Act, therefore, is to require the department of education to examine the feasibility of implementing foreign language education in all public schools beginning with the kindergarten level.
     SECTION 2.  The department of education shall examine the feasibility of implementing and supporting foreign language learning programs in every public school from kindergarten through the twelfth grade, including curriculum, best practices, and funding.  For this purpose, the department of education may collaborate with charter schools and public schools.
     SECTION 3.  The department of education shall submit a report, including findings, recommendations, and proposed legislation, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2012.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
