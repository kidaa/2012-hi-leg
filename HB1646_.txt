RELATING OF EDUCATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that high performing schools should be cloned and not closed by the board of education.  Closing high performing schools is counter-productive to improving the quality of education in Hawaii.

     SECTION 2.  Section 302A-1129, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "[[]§302A-1129[]]  Schools; opening and closing.  The board may open new schools or close existing schools, provided that the board shall not close existing schools that have good standing pending or better as provided in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, P.L. 107-110."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
