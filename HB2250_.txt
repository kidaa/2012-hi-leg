TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE EMERGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL WORKFORCE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the collapse of national credit, housing, financial, and other markets has culminated in the current national economic crisis, which continues to have consequences on the local economy, including significant losses in local construction, restaurant, and other industries.  The legislature further finds that solutions for immediate relief will require unprecedented levels of cooperation between state and local government, and between public and private entities, and bold yet productive proposals.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds for the establishment of an emergency environmental workforce for short-term employment for individuals who are unemployed or underemployed due to the slow economic recovery.  Individuals willing to accept the challenge of an emergency environmental workforce job would assist the State's efforts to:
     (1)  Maintain and strengthen watersheds throughout the State;
     (2)  Eradicate the miconia plant, feral coffee trees, and other invasive plants; and
     (3)  Reduce coqui frog, coffee borer beetle, and fire ant populations.
     The legislature intends for the revenues generated by general obligation bond authorizations and appropriations from the general fund made by this Act to be released only after approximately sixty-five per cent of the total appropriations from various funds made by this Act have been released.  The legislature further intends for the director of finance to have the discretion to determine when approximately sixty-five per cent of the special and other fund appropriations have been made in a manner that fulfills the purpose of this Act.
     SECTION 2.  There is established the emergency environmental workforce to be attached to the research corporation of the University of Hawaii for administrative purposes.  The emergency environmental workforce shall:
     (1)  Employ approximately five hundred to seven hundred fifty individuals who were terminated from their job as a result of the local economic downturn.  The individuals shall be employed as six-month contract employees;
     (2)  Supplement the State's current services being provided for the eradication of the miconia plant and other invasive plants, and the reduction of coqui frog, coffee borer beetle, and fire ant populations; and
     (3)  Coordinate its efforts with the efforts of the department of agriculture, the department of land and natural resources, and the invasive species committee of each county.
     SECTION 3.  The research corporation of the University of Hawaii shall:
     (1)  Together with the Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit, develop a planning, administration, implementation, and evaluation strategy, including a program duration plan and a budget for contract and administrative expenses for the sum appropriated;
     (2)  Develop a recruitment and public information plan, in consultation with private employers with workforces that have been, or that may be, affected by layoffs resulting from the economic downturn;
     (3)  Develop a strategy for the interviewing and selection of emergency environmental workforce program participants, including physical examinations as necessary to qualify applicants prior to final contract offers;
     (4)  Request that attorneys employed or retained by the University of Hawaii prepare, on an expedited basis, the necessary employment contracts to meet the objectives of the emergency environmental workforce program;
     (5)  Submit review and assessment reports to the governor, the senate president, and the speaker of the house of representatives every sixty days for the duration of the emergency environmental workforce program; and
     (6)  Undertake all other necessary activities for emergency environmental workforce program development and implementation.
     SECTION 4.  There is appropriated out of the special land and development fund the sum of $1,400,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the establishment of an emergency environmental workforce to be administered by the research corporation of the University of Hawaii.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the research corporation of the University of Hawaii for the purposes of this Act; provided that no moneys shall be expended without the prior approval of the Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit.
SECTION 5.  There is appropriated out of the forest and wildlife resources fund within the special land and development fund the sum of $500,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the establishment of an emergency environmental workforce to be administered by the research corporation of the University of Hawaii.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the research corporation of the University of Hawaii for the purposes of this Act; provided that no moneys shall be expended without the prior approval of the Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit.
SECTION 6.  There is appropriated out of the land conservation fund the sum of $2,250,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the establishment of an emergency environmental workforce to be administered by the research corporation of the University of Hawaii.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the research corporation of the University of Hawaii for the purposes of this Act; provided that no moneys shall be expended without the prior approval of the Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit.
SECTION 7.  There is appropriated out of the water resource management fund the sum of $300,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the establishment of an emergency environmental workforce to be administered by the research corporation of the University of Hawaii.

     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the research corporation of the University of Hawaii; provided that no moneys shall be expended without the prior approval of the Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit.
