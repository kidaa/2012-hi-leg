TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT VACANCIES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Hawaii has felt the adverse impacts of national and global economies that have seen rising unemployment.  Hawaii's unemployment rate was 6.5 per cent in November 2011.  In contrast to this high level of unemployment, there remain over three thousand vacancies among state job positions.  Some positions have been vacant for decades.  The average vacant state position has been unfilled for a mean length of about nine hundred forty days and a median length of about seven hundred forty-six days.  Over seventy-one thousand individuals are employed with the State.
     The State recognizes that maintaining a job position that may never be filled is an inefficient use of funds, time, and human resources.
     The purpose of this Act is to help encourage state agencies to hire qualified applicants in a timely manner, and to eliminate unnecessary positions by requiring those agencies to fill positions within ten years after a vacancy.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 37, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§37-    Job vacancy elimination.  (a) A state agency shall inform the director of budget and finance of any position in the state agency that has remained vacant for a continuous period of ten years by including a report on the position in the estimate submitted to the department of budget and finance under section 37-34.  The department may consider the vacancy in its determinations under section 37-35 and may reduce the amount allotted to the state agency.
     (b)  If a state agency wants to retain an unfilled position included in the estimate submitted to the department under section 37-34, the state agency shall give the director specific and valid reasons for retaining the position.
     (c)  If the director determines that the reasons given by the state agency are insufficient, the director shall inform the state agency of why the reasons for retaining the position submitted by the state agency are insufficient and shall reduce the position and the amount allotted to the state agency.
     (d)  The director shall report each quarter on actions taken under this section to the legislature in the manner provided under section 93-16.
     (e)  As used in this section:
     "State agency" means any executive department, independent commission, board, agency, authority, bureau, office, or other establishment of the state government (except the legislature and the judiciary), or any quasi-public institution which is supported in whole or in part by state funds.
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
