TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
MAKING AN APPROPRIATION FOR THE LICENSING OF HOME CARE AGENCIES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  In the regular session of 2009, the legislature passed Senate Bill No. 415, S.D. 2, H.D. 1, C.D. 1, which was enacted as Act 21, First Special Session Laws of Hawaii 2009.  The purpose of Act 21 is to ensure that home care agencies meet minimum standards when delivering services to clients by requiring these agencies to be licensed.  Act 21 designated the department of health as the licensing agency.  Since Act 21's enactment, the department has collaborated with home care agencies, consumer advocates, and other stakeholders to draft the administrative rules needed to implement the licensing provisions of Act 21.  These draft rules have gone through the State's rulemaking process and have been approved.
     The department of health intends that licensing fees charged to home care agencies will cover the administrative costs associated with licensing.  However, initial funding is needed to start the licensing process so that fees can be collected.  After the first year, licensing fees will cover the administrative costs of licensing.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds for staffing and other costs to begin the licensing process for home care agencies. 
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 for staffing and other costs associated with the licensing of home care agencies.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of health for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
