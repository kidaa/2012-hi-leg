TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO CONSERVATION DISTRICTS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that marine life conservation districts are vital to both the ocean's fragile ecosystem and the State's tourism industry.  Conservation of the State's shoreline retains the pristine quality of these protected areas.  Although the State has designated marine life conservation districts, more shoreline areas should be protected under this designation.
     The purpose of this Act is to increase the number of marine life conservation districts to better protect near-shore reefs and marine ecosystems and to maintain the State's shorelines for visitors and residents to enjoy.
     SECTION 2.  Section 190-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§190-2  Establishment and modifications of conservation district.  (a)  The department of land and natural resources shall designate marine life conservation districts on each island in the State; provided that not less than five per cent of shoreline on each island in the State shall be included in areas designated as marine life conservation districts.
     (b)  The department of land and natural resources may establish and from time to time modify the limits of one or more conservation districts in each county and may, if it deems necessary, declare all waters within any county a conservation district."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
