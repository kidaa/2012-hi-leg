TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO RUMBLE STRIPS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that many highways in Hawaii serve as the only routes in and out of geographically isolated areas and are the lifeline to essential government services, transportation hubs, and emergency facilities.  One such area is West Maui, which is connected to the rest of Maui by the Honoapiilani Highway.  Although geographically isolated from the rest of the island, the area is home to the second largest visitor destination location in the State of Hawaii and, as such, is an essential economic hub to the State.
The legislature further finds that aside from being a critical commuter and transportation delivery route to West Maui, the Honoapiilani Highway also offers scenic vistas and views of humpback whales during whale season.  For these reasons, many people, especially visitors, often speed or are inattentive while driving on the highway, often resulting in head–on collisions and road run-offs, which can close down this vital link for hours on end.
The legislature further finds that tumble strips are supported by the Federal Highways Administration as part of their highway safety improvement campaign because they are an effective countermeasure to prevent head-on collisions and cross-over or cross-centerline crashes because the noise and vibration produced by rumble strips alert drivers when they leave the traveled way allowing for a safe recovery before an accident occurs.
SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $        or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 to install centerline road rumble strips along the Honoapiilani highway in the county of Maui to protect drivers from head-on collisions and road-run offs.
     The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of transportation for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 2.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
