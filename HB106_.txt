TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO OCEAN SAFETY.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that increased recreational and commercial activities in Hawaii's nearshore waters have lead to safety concerns and, in some cases, tragic results.  In October 2009, a young diver died after being struck by a boat in Maunalua Bay on the island of Oahu, a bay popular with divers, swimmers, and other ocean recreational users. 
     Other nearshore areas statewide are also popular attractions for multiple ocean activities.
     The legislature finds that one such area is Kaanapali beach on the island of Maui.  Installing safety features such as swimming buoys there to more clearly delineate areas reserved for differing uses would ensure greater safety.  The legislature also finds that given the popularity of ocean activities in nearshore areas statewide, a comprehensive safety review of all nearshore areas is warranted.
     The purpose of this Act is to improve ocean safety by:
     (1)  Requiring the department of land and natural resources to review the safety records of nearshore areas statewide; and
     (2)  Appropriating funds for swimming buoys at Kaanapali beach.
     SECTION 2.  (a)  The department of land and natural resources shall review the safety records of nearshore areas statewide, including the range and frequency of ocean activities in each designated nearshore area; any accidents, injuries, and fatalities attributable to the activities; and the success or failure of any safety features such as swimming buoys implemented to ensure public safety.
     (b)  The department shall report to the legislature on the results of the review, including any recommendations for increasing public safety in nearshore waters, no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the 2012 legislative session.
     SECTION 3.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 for swimming buoys at Kaanapali beach for the purpose of increasing the safety of swimmers.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of land and natural resources for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
