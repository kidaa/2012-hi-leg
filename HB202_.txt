TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HOURS OF WORK.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that traffic gridlock has become an undesirable way of life in Hawaii.  Traffic flows more smoothly on the major thoroughfares on state or federal holidays and when public schools or the University of Hawaii are not in session because there are fewer motor vehicles on the road during peak traffic hours.
     The legislature also finds that flexible work schedules can have positive impacts on productivity.  This flexibility gives employees greater freedom to organize their working lives to suit personal needs.
     The purpose of this Act is to authorize a change in business hours for certain executive or judiciary departments to reduce the number of motor vehicles that are on the road during peak commute hours and to provide state employees a more flexible work schedule.
     SECTION 2.  Section 78-1.6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "[[]§78-1.6[]]  Office hours.  (a)  Offices of the State and counties shall be open for the transaction of public business as determined by the chief executive.  Offices need not be open for the transaction of public business on the state holidays designated under section 8-1 and as observed under section 8-2.
     (b)  The appropriate chief executive shall bargain in good faith with the exclusive representative of employees of an agency of the executive branch or judiciary who request to modify the hours of the agency for the transaction of public business; provided that the modified office hours shall consist of nine consecutive hours between the hours of 5:30 a.m. and 8:00 p.m."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
