A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE HAWAII EMPLOYER-UNION HEALTH BENEFITS TRUST FUND.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The purpose of this Act is to make the composition and certain powers and duties of the board of trustees of the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund similar to those of the employees' retirement system board of trustees.  The legislature finds that, in the past, the latter board has operated with more effectiveness, efficiency, and foresight than the former board.
     This Act also clarifies the fiduciary duties of the trust fund board of trustees.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 87A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding four new sections to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§87A-A  Composition of board.  (a)  The board shall consist of eight members as follows:
     (1)  The director of finance, ex officio;
     (2)  Four employees who are enrolled in health benefits plans of the fund.  Two of the four shall be general employees, meaning employees in active service with the State or counties, including police officers and firefighters, but not public school teachers.  One of the four shall be a public school teacher, and one shall be a retired employee.  The four employees shall be elected by employees under rules adopted by the board to terms of six years commencing on the January 1 immediately following the expiration of their predecessors' terms; provided that, if after the close of filing of petitions for candidacy, an employee is unopposed for election to a trustee position, the employee shall be declared to be duly and legally elected to the office of trustee without an election.  If a trustee who is an employee ceases to be enrolled in a health benefits plan of the fund, the trustee shall be disqualified from continuing in office, and the vacancy shall be filled in accordance with section 87A-B; and
     (3)  Three residents of the State who are not employees.  One of the three shall be an officer of a financial institution, public accounting firm, or insurance company authorized to do business in the State or a resident of similar experience.  The three residents shall be appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the senate, to serve for a term of six years commencing on the January 1 immediately following the expiration of their predecessors' terms.
     (b)  Each trustee shall serve until the trustee's successor is elected or appointed, as the case may be, and qualified.
     §87A-B  Vacancy.  If a vacancy occurs in the office of a trustee, the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the office was previously filled, except that in the case of a trustee elected by the employees, the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term by the appointment of an employee by the remaining trustees.
     §87A-C  Voting.  Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the board.  Five concurring votes shall be necessary for a decision by the trustees at any meeting of the board, except that a higher number of votes shall be necessary when required by other law.
     §87A-D  Prohibited interest of trustees and staff members.  Except as provided in this section, no trustee or staff member of the fund shall have any direct interest in the gains or profits of any investment made by the board.  No trustee or staff member shall use, directly or indirectly, for oneself or as an agent in any manner, the moneys of the fund, except to make current and necessary payments authorized by the board.  No trustee or staff member shall be an endorser or surety or be in any manner an obligor for moneys loaned by the board."
