STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO BEES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The University of Hawaii at Hilo has been offering an introductory course on beekeeping for more than twenty years.  The course provides students with hands-on experience with honey bee hives at the university's one-hundred-ten acre farm located in Panaewa, Hawaii.  The university also offers an advanced beekeeping course that allows students to build upon their acquired skills with independent projects that include research and creative activities.
     Ongoing research at the Panaewa farm has been directed at developing more efficient methods for controlling the small hive beetle, which has become a major pest of honey bee hives on the island of Hawaii.  There has reportedly been significant hive loss attributed to the small hive beetle.  Loss of bee hives is a threat to the agricultural economy because bees are necessary to pollenate many crops.  Accordingly, there is a need for further research to develop more efficient methods to control the small hive beetle.
     There are currently twenty-five hives at the Panaewa farm that are used for teaching, but additional hives are needed that can be designated primarily for research.  A new site has been identified at the farm for the research hives, which would benefit not only honey bee health but also student education.  However, moneys are needed to complete and prepare the new site for approximately twenty new hives.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to the University of Hawaii at Hilo to complete and prepare the new bee hive research area at the university's farm located in Panaewa, Hawaii.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $10,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the development of a new bee hive research area at the University of Hawaii at Hilo's farm located in Panaewa, Hawaii, including the purchase of hives and related equipment.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the University of Hawaii for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
