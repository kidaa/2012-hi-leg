TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that every effort must be made to ensure that more renewable energy is used in the State to lessen our dependence on expensive and environmentally harmful fossil fuels.  Currently, each business or homeowner who wants to add distributed generation, including solar or wind power, must undergo a very expensive "interconnection requirement study" if their property is within an area with a high number of homes or businesses with existing solar or wind power systems.  The interconnection requirement study, which can cost between $3,000 and millions of dollars, depending on the size, is designed to determine the area circuit's ability to accept additional distributed generation without adverse effects on others connected to the circuit.  Because each homeowner or business that wants to add distributed generation is forced to conduct the expensive interconnection requirement study, many homeowners and businesses refrain from utilizing these renewable energy sources.  If homeowners and businesses could share the costs of the interconnection requirement study, more people would utilize the renewable energy sources that are so prevalent throughout the State, resulting in a cleaner environment and less dependence on imported oil.
The purpose of this Act is to require the public utilities commission to adopt rules to allow group interconnection requirement studies.
SECTION 2.  The public utilities commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to allow interconnection requirement studies to be conducted and paid for on a group basis.  The group may consist of any number of homeowners and businesses; provided that the homeowners and businesses are a part of the same area circuit.
SECTION 3.  The chair of the public utilities commission shall submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2013 on the status of the rules required under section 2 of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
