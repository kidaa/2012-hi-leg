          SECTION 1.  It is anticipated the State will spend over $1,000,000 annually by 2013 to publish its notices in newspapers.  During these times of economic downturn and decreased tax revenues it is imperative that the State and the counties look for ways to trim their costs.  The purpose of this Act is to allow state and county agencies to electronically publish their notices online.

     (1)  For statewide distribution:
         (A)  In a daily or weekly publication of statewide circulation; or
         (B)  By publication in separate daily or weekly publications whose combined circulation is statewide; [and] or
         (C)  By electronic or online publication on the official website of the State; and
     (2)  For county-wide publication, by publication in a daily or weekly publication in the affected county[.] or by electronic or online publication on the official website of the affected county.
[Additional supplemental notice may also be given through Hawaii FYI, the State's interactive computer system.]"
     SECTION 3.  Section 1-28.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:
     "(c)  Whenever a public notice is published [in a newspaper or other publication] as described in subsection (a), proof of publication shall be the affidavit of the printer, publisher, principal clerk, or business manager of the newspaper or other publication or of the designated agent of the group that published the notice[.], or of the designated representative of the agency whose notice is published electronically or online."
     SECTION 4.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
