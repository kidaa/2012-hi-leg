STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU TO PROHIBIT PARKING ON DATE STREET BETWEEN KAPIOLANI BOULEVARD AND LA‘AU STREET DURING THE MORNING HOURS TO ALLEVIATE TRAFFIC CONGESTION.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, traffic congestion continues to increase around Hawaii's schools; and
 
     WHEREAS, the five way intersection at Kapiolani Boulevard, Date Street, and Kamoku Street is situated along a major corridor that accommodates traffic coming off of the H-1 Freeway; and
 
     WHEREAS, I‘olani School is a college preparatory school for over 1,800 students in grades K-12; and
 
     WHEREAS, I‘olani School has two areas where students are dropped off and picked up from school including one for the upper school that is situated on Kamoku Street and another for the lower school that is situated on La‘au Place; and
 
     WHEREAS, the roads around I‘olani School handle a tremendous volume of traffic during the morning hours when students are either driving to or being dropped off at school; and
 
     WHEREAS, although the City and County of Honolulu already prohibits parking on the makai side of Date Street between Kapiolani Boulevard and La‘au Street during the afternoon hours, street parking on the makai side of Date Street between Kapiolani and La‘au is allowed, and continues to occur, during the morning hours; and
 
     WHEREAS, due to vehicles being parked along Date Street during the morning hours, particularly before I‘olani school begins its instructional day, traffic backs up on Date Street as drivers approaching La‘au Street from the east turn right into La‘au Street to drop off students which prevents vehicles wishing to continue straight along Date Street from doing so; and
 
     WHEREAS, prohibiting vehicles from parking along Date Street between Kapiolani Boulevard and La‘au Street during the morning hours would alleviate this congestion as vehicles wishing to turn into La‘au Street could use the right lane on Date Street and vehicles wishing to proceed straight could use the left lane; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the City and County of Honolulu is requested to prohibit parking along the makai side of Date Street between Kapiolani Boulevard and La‘au Street during the morning hours when traffic entering and leaving I‘olani School is at its peak; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu, Chairperson of the Honolulu City Council, and the Director of the Department of Transportation Services of the City and County of Honolulu.
