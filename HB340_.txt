A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO SCHOOLS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  School closures and consolidations are driven by scales of economy but can be accompanied by school and community resistance based on assorted legitimate concerns.  School closures or consolidations are best accomplished if the benefits to the system are balanced with benefits to the individual schools and communities.
     The purpose of this Act is to require the department of education to conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine the expected cost savings of school closures or consolidations, and to require that fifty per cent of the actual fiscal savings be retained by the new configuration of affected schools for a period of not less than five years.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§302A-    School closures or consolidations.  (a)  The department, in consultation with the department of land and natural resources and any other governmental agencies as may be necessary, shall conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine the expected cost savings of any school closure or school consolidation.  The department shall submit a report on its cost-benefit analysis, findings, and recommendations on each proposed school closure or school consolidation to the board for its review and approval.
     (b)  If any school closure or school consolidation occurs, fifty per cent of the actual fiscal savings shall be retained by the new configuration of affected schools for a period of not less than five years.
     For purposes of this section, fiscal savings shall be computed by adding the total costs in the last year of operation for any affected school that is eliminated as a result of a closure or consolidation."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
