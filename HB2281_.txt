TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HUMAN SERVICES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature recognizes that effective communication between patient and provider, in discussing medical treatment plans, communicating diagnoses, and making a host of medical decisions, is an important component of quality health care access and delivery in the State.  Achieving this level of communication is often challenging when the patient has limited English proficiency.  Steps must be taken by providers to ensure that limited English proficiency will not compromise the receipt of quality health care.
     The purpose of this Act is to ensure that access plans are developed to ensure that limited English proficiency will not impede the receipt of quality health care services from medical assistance programs administered by the department of human services.
     SECTION 2.  Section 346-14, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:

     (7)  Administer the medical assistance programs for eligible public welfare and other medically needy individuals by establishing standards, eligibility, and health care participation rules, payment methodologies, reimbursement allowances, systems to monitor recipient and provider compliance, and an access plan that includes medical care providers' efforts to address the needs of individuals with limited English proficiency, and assuring compliance with federal requirements to maximize federal financial participation;
     (8)  Cooperate with the federal government in carrying out the purposes of the Social Security Act and in other matters of mutual concern pertaining to public welfare, public assistance, and child welfare services, including the making of reports, the adoption of methods of administration, and the making of rules as are found by the federal government, or any properly constituted authority thereunder, to be necessary or desirable for the efficient operation of the plans for public welfare, assistance, and child welfare services or as may be necessary or desirable for the receipt of financial assistance from the federal government;
     (9)  Carry on research and compile statistics relative to public and private welfare activities throughout the State, including those dealing with dependence, defectiveness, delinquency, and related problems;
    (10)  Develop plans in cooperation with other public and private agencies for the prevention and treatment of conditions giving rise to public welfare problems;

    (14)  Determine the appropriate level for the Hawaii security net, by developing a tracking and monitoring system to determine what segments of the population are not able to afford the basic necessities of life, and advise the legislature annually regarding the resources required to maintain the security net at the appropriate level;
    (15)  Subject to the appropriation of state funds and availability of federal matching assistance, expand optional health care to low-income persons as follows:
         (A)  Pregnant women and infants under one year of age living in families with incomes up to one hundred eighty-five per cent of the federal poverty level and without any asset restrictions;
         (B)  Children under six years of age living in families with incomes up to one hundred thirty-three per cent of the federal poverty level and without any asset restrictions;

    [(6)] (7)  Allows standing referrals to specialists capable of providing and coordinating primary and specialty care for an enrollee's life-threatening, chronic, degenerative, or disabling disease or condition."
