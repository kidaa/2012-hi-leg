HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES TO EXPAND ITS INTERPRETATION OF THE USE PROVISION IN HANA HEALTH'S LAND LEASE.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Hana District, on the island of Maui, has one of the poorest health profiles in Hawaii and is federally designated as a medically underserved community; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Hana District, often referred to as the "last Hawaiian place", is one of the most isolated areas in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hana Health is a federally qualified health center that provides healthcare services to the people of the Hana District, regardless of their ability to pay; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hana Health operates facilities on two parcels of land, both of which are owned by the State and have been leased to Hana Health for fifty-five years at $1 per year; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Department of Land and Natural Resources has interpreted the use provision in Hana Health's land lease to prohibit income generating activities and certain ancillary programs offered by Hana Health; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Department of Land and Natural Resources' restrictive interpretation of Hana Health's land lease is not supported by the language of the lease, Hana Health's articles of incorporation, or state or federal law; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Department of Land and Natural Resources' interpretation of the land lease inhibits Hana Health's efforts to become self-sustaining and less reliant on public funds; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Land and Natural Resources is requested to expand its interpretation of the use provision in Hana Health's land lease to include income generating activities and ancillary programs as permissible uses; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor; the Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources; the Mayor of Maui County; and the Executive Director of Hana Health.
