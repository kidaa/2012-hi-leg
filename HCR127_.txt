HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE HAWAII COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY AND KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS TO CONSIDER AN EXCHANGE OF LAND.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the State, through the Hawaii Community Development Authority, and the Trustees of the Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, now known and hereafter referred to as Kamehameha Schools, entered into a land exchange agreement dated July 2, 1991; and
 
     WHEREAS, the land exchange contemplated in the 1991 agreement was realized almost one year later through the execution of an exchange deed dated March 11, 1992; and
 
     WHEREAS, the land owned by Kamehameha Schools that was transferred to the State to be managed by the Hawaii Community Development Authority pursuant to the agreement and deed consisted of parcels of land known as Honolulu Ford Block situated in Kakaako, Heeia Wetlands situated in the District of Koolaupoko, and an approximately seventy-acre portion of Heeia Meadowlands situated in the District of Koolaupoko; and
 
     WHEREAS, the land owned by the State that was transferred to Kamehameha Schools pursuant to the agreement and deed consisted of a parcel of land known as the Board of Water Supply site situated in Kakaako; and
 
     WHEREAS, as a condition of the land exchange, the State provided additional consideration to Kamehameha Schools, including assistance with subdivision of land and obtaining development permits, award of housing credits transferrable to fulfill requirements to provide affordable housing imposed on any of Kamehameha Schools' developments on the island of Oahu, and award of a Public Facility Dedication Credit constituting an exemption from or credit against the public facilities dedication requirement that may be imposed on Kamehameha Schools' land development activities within the Kakaako Community Development District; and
 
     WHEREAS, transfer of the seventy-acre portion of Heeia Meadowlands was subject to certain development conditions, including the reconveyance of the land back to Kamehameha Schools in the event that the State elected to not develop it; and
 
     WHEREAS, at the time of the land exchange, the State anticipated that the subject lands would be developed for residential or commercial use, as appropriate, as evidenced by the development-incentivizing conditions and consideration that were part of the exchange; and
 
     WHEREAS, it appears that Kamehameha Schools has not yet, as of the present time, developed the Board of Water Supply site, despite this site's prime location within the Kakaako Community Development District in urban Honolulu and in close proximity to major transportation corridors and to downtown Honolulu; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Board of Water Supply site has the potential to serve as a valuable asset, both in terms of the contribution that its full use could make to the urban Honolulu community and the Kakaako Community Development District and in terms of potential public and private revenue that it could generate; and
 
     WHEREAS, the State is willing to take on the responsibility of developing the Board of Water Supply site to achieve its highest and best appropriate use within its urban context, which includes the Kakaako Community Development District; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Hawaii Community Development Authority and Kamehameha Schools are hereby encouraged to consider a new land exchange whereby the State shall acquire the land known as the Board of Water Supply site situated in Kakaako in exchange for conveying to Kamehameha Schools suitably-zoned state land of the same fair market value; and      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Hawaii Community Development Authority is requested to submit a report to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013 on the status of any discussions or negotiations of the land exchange requested to be considered by this measure; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Trustees of the Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop and to the Executive Director of the Hawaii Community Development Authority.
