     (1)  The sum from all general excise tax revenues realized by the State that represents the difference between $45,000,000 and the proceeds from the sale of any general obligation bonds authorized for that fiscal year for the purposes of the state educational facilities improvement special fund shall be deposited in the state treasury in each fiscal year to the credit of the state educational facilities improvement special fund;
     (2)  A sum, not to exceed $5,000,000, from all general excise tax revenues realized by the State shall be deposited in the state treasury in each fiscal year to the credit of the compound interest bond reserve fund; [and]
     (3)  A sum from all general excise tax revenues realized by the State that is equal to one-half of the total amount of funds appropriated or transferred out of the hurricane reserve trust fund under sections 4 and 5 of Act 62, Session Laws of Hawaii 2011, shall be deposited into the hurricane reserve trust fund in fiscal year 2013-2014 and in fiscal year 2014-2015; provided that the deposit required in each fiscal year shall be made by October 1 of that fiscal year[.]; and
     (4)  In each fiscal year from fiscal year 2013-2014 to fiscal year 2043-2044, $500,000,000 from all general excise tax revenues realized by the State shall be deposited into the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the trust fund.  No portion of the deposit required under this paragraph shall be used to pay the employer contributions toward the annual employee-beneficiaries' and dependent-beneficiaries' health benefits plan premium costs or medicare part B premium reimbursements or administrative expenses of the trust fund.  This paragraph shall not prevent the legislature from appropriating by legislative act other general or non-general funds to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2013.
