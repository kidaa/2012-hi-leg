TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH A MORATORIUM ON ELECTRICITY RATE INCREASES UNTIL JUNE 30, 2014, AND CONSIDER MODIFICATION OF THE AUTOMATIC FUEL ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITIES.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the cost-of-living for Hawaii residents is among the highest in the country, while average wages for Hawaii's workers are among the lowest; and
 
     WHEREAS, average wages in Hawaii have remained stagnant over the past three years and the unemployment level in the State has failed to show a significant decrease; and
 
     WHEREAS, electricity rates have risen steadily each year at a rate that outpaces wage increases and makes this necessary expense difficult for many households to afford; and
 
     WHEREAS, a moratorium on rate increases for electricity would benefit the economy of Hawaii by stabilizing the cost-of living and improving the finances of many households; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Public Utilities Commission is requested to establish a moratorium on electricity rate level increases requested by any electric utility until June 30, 2014, unless the Public Utilities Commission finds that extraordinary circumstances exist to justify the increase; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Public Utilities Commission is requested to consider modification of the automatic fuel adjustment clause for electric utilities, in recognition that other Hawaii businesses do not have similar automatic adjustments for their cost of goods; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Finance and the Chairperson of the Public Utilities Commission.
