HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
ENCOURAGING THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO PROCURE GOODS AND SERVICES THAT ARE USED TO SUPPORT HAWAII-BASED UNITED STATES MILITARY PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES FROM HAWAII BUSINESSES AND TO COOPERATE WITH THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF HAWAII TO HOST TRADE SHOWS THAT FEATURE LOCAL BUSINESSES.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, United States military contracting officers are able to purchase goods, supplies, and services available from local sources; and
 
     WHEREAS, between 2007 and 2009, the average annual Department of Defense procurements in Hawaii totaled $2.307 billion, and over fifty-eight per cent of those procurement expenses were made from a vendor with an address in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, among the many categories of Hawaii goods and services purchased by the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense spent the most in construction; professional, scientific, and technical services; and administrative and support services; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Defense Logistics Agency, in conjunction with a local Defense Logistics Agency representative, manages a trade show in Hawaii that highlights products to be stocked in military stores, and the trade show has been successful in placing Hawaii-sourced food and beverage products in military commissaries and exchanges; and
 
     WHEREAS, the trade show has proven so popular that participation must be limited, and in the past, interested vendors have been turned away; and
 
     WHEREAS, conducting trade shows involving local businesses, including small businesses, would provide opportunities for these businesses to demonstrate their products and services to military contracting officers, who could visit exhibits, discuss their needs, and learn about opportunities to procure from local sources; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the United States Department of Defense is encouraged to procure a greater percentage of goods and services that it needs for its Hawaii-based military personnel and facilities from Hawaii businesses; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the appropriate agencies of the Department of Defense are urged to cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii to manage trade shows and other events, including events in larger venues that can accommodate more local small businesses, that highlight and exhibit locally-sourced goods and services for military contracting officers; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor; the Commander of the United States Pacific Command; the commanders of the United States Pacific Fleet, United States Army Pacific, Pacific Air Forces, United States Marine Corps Forces Pacific, 14th Coast Guard District; the commanders of the Naval Facilities and Engineering Command - Pacific, Naval Facilities and Engineering Command - Hawaii, Pacific Fleet and Industrial Supply - Hawaii, United States Army Corps of Engineers - Pacific Region, United States Army Corps of Engineers - Hawaii Region, United States Army Garrison Hawaii, and United States Marine Corps Base Hawaii; the Military Affairs Council of the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii; and the members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.
