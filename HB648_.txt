TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO NOISE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Tourism is Hawaii's most important industry and the most critical to the economic growth and standard of living enjoyed by many of Hawaii's residents.  On average, Hawaii hosts over six million visitors annually that account for over $10,000,000,000 dollars in annual revenue.  While economic diversification has been promoted and continues to show promising growth, dependence on activities generated by the visitor industry will affect Hawaii's economy for years to come.
     Therefore, the legislature finds that it is imperative that disruptions to the visitor industry such as those experienced by visitors during recent labor disputes in the hotel industry be minimized to the greatest extent possible.  Preserving the reputation of Hawaii as a pleasant and peaceful vacation destination will ultimately work toward sustaining the State's tourism industry, the engine that drives Hawaii's economy, and is in the State's best interest.
     The purpose of this Act is to limit noise disruptions around visitor accommodations resulting from picketing.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 342F, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§342F-      Picketing; restrictions.  (a)  It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to make or to use a sound generating device that emits a noise that is audible at a distance of one hundred feet while picketing within fifty feet of any hotel premises in the state, except between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. on any day except Sunday or a state or federal holiday, and between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on Sunday or any state or federal holiday.
     (b)  Violators shall be fined $50 for the first violation, $100 for the second violation, $200 for the third violation, and $500 for each subsequent violation.
     (c)  As used in this section:
     "Hotel" means any building or portion thereof or buildings containing more than nine rooming units, in which space is let by the owner or operator to six or more unrelated persons.
     "Sound generating device" means any device used to emit sound, including drums, cans, bells, horns, and loudspeakers.
     "State holiday" means any day established as a state holiday in section 8-1."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
