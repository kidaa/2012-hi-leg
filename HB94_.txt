A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the department of human services receives federal and state funds to administer the State's public assistance programs.  Because tax revenues are used to fund public assistance programs, the legislature is concerned that these programs are administered in the most effective and efficient manner possible.  The legislature believes that any opportunity to defraud or abuse these important public assistance programs should be addressed and rectified.
     SECTION 2.  The auditor shall conduct a financial and management audit of the department of human services relating to the public assistance programs that the department administers under section 346-14.  The audit shall include but not be limited to a determination of:
     (1)  The amount of federal funds received to administer each public assistance program;
     (2)  The amount of state funds received to administer each public assistance program;
     (3)  Compliance with both federal and state laws relating to restrictions on funding of these programs;
     (4)  The number of public assistance recipients for each public assistance program;
     (5)  Whether each public assistance program is implemented and managed in a manner that conforms with the purpose of the program in an effective and efficient manner; and
     (6)  To what extent any public assistance program is vulnerable to fraud or abuse and whether there has been any significant incidence of fraud or abuse in any program.
     SECTION 3.  The auditor shall submit a report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to convening of the regular session 2012 containing findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, concerning the department of human services' use of federal and state funds relating to the implementation of the State's public assistance programs and the efficient and effective management of these programs.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
