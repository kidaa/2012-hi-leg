HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TASK FORCE TO EXAMINE STATE REGULATION OF THE HARVESTING OF HAWAIIAN SANDALWOOD.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, an unsubstantiated concern has been raised regarding a steady decline of all native sandalwood species in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, any decline has historically been caused by non-native mammals, insects, fire, and diseases that limit regeneration and growth of existing trees; and
 
     WHEREAS, while protection of native sandalwood species is afforded on state lands and within the state conservation district, there is no regulation or oversight on the harvest, sale, or destruction of native sandalwood species on privately owned or managed lands, including conservation districts; and
 
     WHEREAS, the commercial harvesting of native sandalwood is a promising new industry in the State that will provide many new jobs and increase exports; and
 
     WHEREAS, in October 2012, the International Sandalwood Symposium 2012 will be held at the University of Hawaii at Manoa where stakeholders, experts, students, and members of the public with interests in the international sandalwood industry will discuss scientific research, conservation, ethnobotany, commercialization, and other aspects of sandalwood species and resources; and
 
     WHEREAS, state regulation of the harvesting of Hawaiian sandalwood has been suggested as a means to promote native sandalwood species; and
 
     WHEREAS, any system of regulating the harvesting of Hawaiian sandalwood should consider the findings and recommendations of the International Sandalwood Symposium 2012, as well as input from experts in relevant scientific fields, foresters, government agencies, landowners, and stakeholders; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources is requested to convene a task force, after the October 2012 International Sandalwood Symposium, to examine state regulation of the harvesting of Hawaiian sandalwood and to serve as chair of the task force; and
