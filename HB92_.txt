RELATING TO RENTAL PROPERTY MANAGERS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Chapter 521, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§521-    Rental property manager.  (a)  Every rental property manager who manages three or more dwelling units shall:
     (1)  Be a:
         (A)  Licensed real estate broker in compliance with chapter 467 and the rules of the real estate commission.  With respect to any requirement for a corporate rental property manager in any condominium declaration or bylaws recorded before July 1, 2006, any rental property manager organized as a limited liability company shall be deemed to be organized as a corporation for the purposes of this paragraph, unless the declaration or bylaws are expressly amended after July 1, 2006, to require that the rental property manager be organized as a corporation and not as a limited liability company; or
         (B)  Corporation authorized to do business under article 8 of chapter 412;
     (2)  Register with the real estate commission prior to conducting rental property manager activity through approval of a completed registration application, payment of fees, and submission of any other additional information set forth by the commission.  The registration shall be for a biennial period with termination on December 31 of an even-numbered year.  The real estate commission shall prescribe a deadline date prior to the termination date for the submission of a completed re-registration application, payment of fees, and any other additional information set forth by the commission.  Any rental property manager subject to this section who has not met the submission requirements by the deadline date shall be considered a new applicant for registration and subject to initial registration requirements.  The information required to be submitted with any application shall include the name, business address, phone number, and names of landlords managed;
     (3)  Obtain and keep current a fidelity bond in an amount equal to $500 multiplied by the aggregate number of dwelling units of the landlord managed by the rental property manager; provided that the amount of the fidelity bond shall not be less than $20,000 nor greater than $500,000.  Upon request by the real estate commission, the rental property manager shall provide evidence of a current fidelity bond or a certification statement from an insurance company authorized by the insurance division of the department of commerce and consumer affairs certifying that the fidelity bond is in effect and meets the requirements of this section and the rules adopted by the commission.  The rental property manager shall permit only employees covered by the fidelity bond to handle or have custody or control of any landlord funds, except any principals of the rental property manager that cannot be covered by the fidelity bond.  The fidelity bond shall protect the rental property manager against the loss of any landlord's moneys, securities, or other properties caused by the fraudulent or dishonest acts of employees of the rental property manager.  Failure to obtain or maintain a fidelity bond in compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant thereto, including failure to provide evidence of the fidelity bond coverage in a timely manner to the commission, shall result in nonregistration or the automatic termination of the registration, unless an approved exemption or a bond alternative is presently maintained.  A rental property manager who is unable to obtain a fidelity bond may seek an exemption from the fidelity bond requirement from the commission;
     (4)  Act promptly and diligently to recover from the fidelity bond, if the fraud or dishonesty of the rental property manager's employees causes a loss to a landlord, and apply the fidelity bond proceeds, if any, to reduce the landlord's loss.  If more than one landlord suffers a loss, the rental property manager shall divide the proceeds among the landlords in proportion to each landlord's loss.  A landlord may request a court order requiring the rental property manager to act promptly and diligently to recover from the fidelity bond.  If a landlord cannot recover its loss from the fidelity bond proceeds of the rental property manager, the landlord may recover by court order from the real estate recovery fund established under section 467-16, provided that:
         (A)  The loss is caused by the fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit of the rental property manager or its employees;
         (B)  The rental property manager is a licensed real estate broker; and
         (C)  The landlord fulfills the requirements of sections 467-16 and 467-18 and any applicable rules of the real estate commission;
     (5)  Pay a nonrefundable application fee and, upon approval, an initial registration fee, and subsequently pay a re-registration fee, as prescribed by rules adopted by the director of commerce and consumer affairs pursuant to chapter 91.  A compliance resolution fee shall also be paid pursuant to section 26‑9(o) and the rules adopted pursuant thereto; and
     (6)  Report immediately in writing to the real estate commission any changes to the information contained on the registration application or any other documents provided for registration.  Failure to do so may result in termination of registration and subject the rental property manager to initial registration requirements.
     (b)  The real estate commission may deny any registration or re-registration application or terminate a registration without hearing if the fidelity bond and supporting documents fail to meet the requirements of this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant thereto.
     (c)  Every rental property manager shall be considered a fiduciary with respect to any dwelling unit managed by that rental property manager.
     (d)  The registration requirements of this section shall not apply to active real estate brokers in compliance with and licensed under chapter 467.
     (e)  If a rental property manager receives a request from the commission to distribute any commission-generated information, printed material, or documents to the landlord, the rental property manager shall make the distribution at the cost of the landlord within a reasonable period of time after receiving the request.  The requirements of this subsection apply to all rental property managers.
     (f)  The real estate commission may adopt rules under chapter 91 to implement this section."
     SECTION 2.  Section 521-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows:
     ""Rental property manager" means any person who, for compensation or valuable consideration, acts as an agent for the management of more than three separate dwelling units owned by another person or entity and who is responsible for the collection of rental payments pursuant to a rental agreement from tenants residing in those dwelling units.  The term includes a person who acts as an agent on behalf of a landlord as defined in this section.  The term shall not include resident managers, whether residing on-site or off-site, who are not responsible for the collection of rental payments from tenants."
     SECTION 3.  Section 467-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending the definition of "custodian or caretaker" to read as follows:
     ""Custodian or caretaker" means any individual, who for compensation or valuable consideration, is employed as an employee by a single owner and has the responsibility to manage or care for that real property left in the individual's trust; provided that the term "custodian" or "caretaker" shall not include any individual who [leases]:
