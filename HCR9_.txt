     WHEREAS, due to the high costs of fertility preservation procedures, the procedure is unattainable for many people; and

     WHEREAS, House Bill No.    has been introduced during the Regular Session of 2012 to mandate health insurance screening coverage for fertility preservation procedures; and
 
WHEREAS, section 23-51, Hawaii Revised Statutes, requires that:
 
"Before any legislative measure that mandates health insurance coverage for specific health services, specific diseases, or certain providers of health care services as part of individual or group health insurance policies, can be considered, there shall be concurrent resolutions passed requesting the auditor to prepare and submit to the legislature a report that assesses both the social and financial effects of the proposed mandated coverage…"; and
 
     WHEREAS, section 23-52, Hawaii Revised Statutes, outlines the specific topics to be addressed in the Auditor's report required under section 23-51, Hawaii Revised Statutes; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Auditor is requested to conduct an impact assessment report pursuant to sections 23-51 and 23-52, Hawaii Revised Statutes, of the social and financial effects of mandating coverage for fertility preservation procedures for persons who are of reproductive age and have been diagnosed with cancer, and will undergo treatment that may adversely affect the person's fertility as further described by House Bill No.    (Regular Session of 2012); and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor is requested to submit a report on the Auditor's findings and recommendations to the Legislature at least twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Auditor and the Insurance Commissioner who, in turn, is requested to transmit copies to each organization that issues health insurance policies in the State that may be affected by this Concurrent Resolution.
