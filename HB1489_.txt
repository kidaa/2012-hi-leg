TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO DEPARTMENT OF HAWAIIAN HOME LANDS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that homelessness has been increasing rapidly in Hawaii and that the State has opened several new shelters.  In spite of efforts by government and nonprofit organizations to provide overnight shelter to homeless persons, there are still many homeless persons who sleep in public parks, along sidewalks, and other similar areas.
     The legislature further finds that native Hawaiians constitute a substantial percentage of the homeless persons in Hawaii.  Nearly forty per cent of the homeless population is native Hawaiian.  Many of these individuals choose not to use homeless shelters because their lifestyles conflict with shelter rules.
     The purpose of this Act is to address the disproportionate representation of native Hawaiians among the State's homeless by requiring the department of Hawaiian home lands to develop a pilot program to establish a kanaka village for homeless native Hawaiians.
     SECTION 2.  (a)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the department of Hawaiian home lands shall develop and implement a pilot program to establish a kanaka village for native Hawaiians who are homeless.  The department of Hawaiian home lands shall:
     (1)  Collaborate with the office of Hawaiian affairs and the Hawaii public housing authority to develop and implement the program;
     (2)  Designate the island on which to establish the kanaka village; and
     (3)  Establish the kanaka village on Hawaiian home lands.
     (b)  For the purposes of this Act, "kanaka village" means a community where native Hawaiians who are homeless may live in tents and subsist off the land utilizing traditional Hawaiian methods of sustainability.
     SECTION 3.  The department of Hawaiian home lands, in consultation with the office of Hawaiian affairs and the Hawaii public housing authority, shall report to the legislature, no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2012, regarding actions taken for the pilot program and whether the pilot program should be extended to establish additional kanaka villages throughout the State.  The report shall include any pertinent information, recommendations, and necessary proposed legislation.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
