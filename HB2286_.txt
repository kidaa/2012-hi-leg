TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the supplemental nutrition assistance program, formerly known as the food stamp program, is a federal and state program to help low-income families buy the food they need to stay healthy and be productive members of society.  In 2010, the federal government increased funding to the supplemental nutrition assistance program and changed the rules to allow more families to qualify.  Since unemployment checks caused many to gross more than the one hundred thirty per cent threshold, the federal government increased the gross income limit to two hundred per cent.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to the department of human services to respond to the United States Department of Agriculture's mandate to amend supplemental nutrition assistance program income eligibility requirements, thereby increasing the number of potential beneficiaries of the program.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $2,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for the department of human services to increase staff and the department's electronic system's capacity to respond to the United States Department of Agriculture's mandate to amend supplemental nutrition assistance program eligibility requirement from one hundred thirty per cent of the income poverty guidelines prescribed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services to two hundred per cent of the income poverty guidelines.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of human services for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
