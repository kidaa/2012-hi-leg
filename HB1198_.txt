RELATING TO OCEAN RECREATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that federal law requires the inspection and certification of sailing school vessels through a defined and rigorous process.  Maintaining a valid certificate ensures that the vessel continues to be operated in accordance with standards for safety and seaworthiness.
     The purpose of this Act is to require a valid certificate of inspection from the United States Coast Guard, pursuant to Title 46 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 169, for designation as a sailing school vessel.
     SECTION 2.  Section 200-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending the definition of "sailing school vessel" to read as follows:
     ""Sailing school vessel" means a vessel:
     (1)  Less than five hundred gross tons, carrying six or more individuals who are sailing school students or sailing school instructors principally equipped for propulsion by sail even if the vessel has an auxiliary means of propulsion; [and]
     (2)  Owned or leased by a corporation, association, organization, or other duly chartered entity determined under the Internal Revenue Code to be exempt from the federal income tax and operated for the purpose of providing sailing instruction and therapeutic, educational, recreational, vocational, or family counseling services to emotionally disturbed youth or to youth sentenced by the family court to a rehabilitative sailing program and their families[.]; and
     (3)  That has a valid certificate of inspection from the United States Coast Guard under Title 46 Code of Federal Regulations Part 169."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
