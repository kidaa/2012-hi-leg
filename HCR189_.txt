HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII WEST OAHU TO ESTABLISH A GRADUATE-LEVEL INFORMATION ASSURANCE PROGRAM.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the federal government has a significant presence in Hawaii, in part because of our state's strategic location at the crossroads of the Pacific; and
 
     WHEREAS, government agencies, along with businesses such as defense contractors and financial institutions, need to hire additional employees who are capable of protecting vital information systems; and
 
     WHEREAS, the National Security Agency (NSA) established a new National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Operations Program; and
 
     WHEREAS, this hands-on higher education program is deeply technical, inter-disciplinary and firmly grounded in computer science, computer engineering and/or electrical engineering disciplines; and
 
WHEREAS, this program supports the President's National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education; and
 
WHEREAS, the goal of the President's initiative is broadening the pool of workers with the capacity to support a cyber-secure nation; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii currently lacks a sufficient number of residents trained in high-level cybersecurity operations; and
 
WHEREAS, Hawaii is one of just eleven states lacking a national Center of Academic Excellence in cyber operations; and
 
WHEREAS, the University of Hawaii could fill this void by offering a graduate-level Information Assurance Program that meets requirements of the NSA and Department of Homeland Security; and
 
     WHEREAS, students enrolled in such a program would be eligible for financial aid through the Department of Defense Information Assurance Scholarship Program and the Federal Cyber Service Scholarship for Service Program; and
 
     WHEREAS, gaining national recognition for a cybersecurity degree program would enable the University to compete for related federal research grants; and
 
WHEREAS, educating students in advanced cyber operations would enable the University to play a more prominent role in securing America's information systems; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the University of Hawaii at Manoa College of Engineering is urged to establish an Information Assurance Program at the earliest possible opportunity; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the University of Hawaii Board of Regents, the University System President and the University of Hawaii West Oahu Chancellor.
