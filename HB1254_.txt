TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
MAKING AN APPROPRIATION TO THE COUNTIES FOR DROUGHT MITIGATION PROJECTS AND MEASURES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that a viable agriculture industry requires a steady, reliable supply of water.  However, drought conditions continue to adversely affect local farms and ranches, hampering their ability to produce quality products on a consistent basis throughout the year.
     The legislature also finds that to address the harmful impact of droughts, mitigation measures in the Hawaii drought plan must be implemented.  The goal of the Hawaii drought plan is to develop coordinated emergency response mechanisms and to outline steps toward mitigating the effects of future droughts.
     The Hawaii drought plan provides clear policies and directs responsible agencies to implement immediate, short-term, and long-term response measures to mitigate the impact of droughts.  In 2004, county drought committees were formed for each of the four counties in Hawaii.  Each of the county drought committees developed a drought mitigation strategy for its respective county that emphasizes drought mitigation projects.  These county drought mitigation strategies represent the local needs and concerns of each county and are incorporated by reference into the Hawaii drought plan.
     The legislature further finds that to adequately implement the Hawaii drought plan, sufficient funding for the counties is necessary to address the many challenges that the State's agriculture industry faces in preparing for droughts.
     The purpose of this Act is to provide funding for drought mitigation projects and measures in each county of the State.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $4,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 to provide funding to the several counties for agricultural drought mitigation plans, measures, and projects.  The specific county appropriations are as follows:
     County of Hawaii                      $
     County of Kauai                       $
     County of Maui                        $
     City and county of Honolulu           $
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the respective counties for the purposes of this Act; provided that moneys appropriated under this Act shall not be made available to a county unless the county coordinates its drought mitigation activities with the department of land and natural resources.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
