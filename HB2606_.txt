RELATING TO TAX CLEARANCE FEES.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Taxpayers are required to obtain tax clearances from the department of taxation for various purposes, including obtaining a government contract or receiving final payment on a government contract.  Currently, taxpayers may obtain tax clearances without paying a fee for the tax clearance.  The department of taxation processes approximately 20,000 to 30,000 tax clearance requests per year.  In addition, certified copies of the tax clearance can also be obtained from the department of taxation without paying a fee.  Approximately, 30,000 certified copies of tax clearances are provided each year.  This Act would impose a $20 fee on taxpayers to request a tax clearance and a $5 fee to obtain a certified copy of a tax clearance.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 231, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§231-    Tax clearance fees.  The department may charge a fee of $20 for each tax clearance application submitted by a taxpayer and $5 for each certified copy of a tax clearance issued to a taxpayer.  The department may charge additional fees related to the issuance of tax clearances."
      SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval and shall apply to requests for tax clearances and requests for certified copies of tax clearances received on or after July 1, 2012.
