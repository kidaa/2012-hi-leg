TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO EDUCATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Act 167, Session Laws of Hawaii 2010, mandated one hundred eighty days of instruction at all schools, beginning with school years 2011-2013.  The legislature finds that the application of this requirement to multi-track schools would create undue hardship on the students, parents, and staff at the multi-track schools, such as the elimination of a common winter break or the need to hold classes on Saturdays.
     SECTION 2.  Section 302A-251, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsections (a) and (b) to read as follows:
     "(a)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, for the 2011-2013 school years, all public schools, except charter schools[,] and multi-track department of education schools, shall implement a school year of one hundred eighty days, excluding professional development days and other non-instructional days negotiated pursuant to chapter 89, that shall include:
     (1)  Nine hundred fifteen student instructional hours for the elementary school grades; and
     (2)  Nine hundred ninety student instructional hours for the secondary school grades.
     (b)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, for the 2013-2015 school years, all public schools, except charter schools[,] and multi-track department of education schools, shall implement a school year of one hundred eighty days, excluding professional development days and other non-instructional days negotiated pursuant to chapter 89, that shall include one thousand eighty student instructional hours for both elementary and secondary school grades.  Multi-track department of education schools shall implement a school year of not fewer than one hundred seventy-one days, excluding professional development days and other non-instructional days negotiated pursuant to chapter 89, which shall include one thousand eighty student instructional hours for both elementary and secondary school grades."
     SECTION 3.  This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date.
     SECTION 4.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.

     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
