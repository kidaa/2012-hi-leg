A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO AGRICULTURE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that there has been a proliferation of residential dwellings within agricultural districts that may not be occupied in connection with an actual farm.  This Act should reduce the attractiveness of agricultural land for subdivision and development into "fake farms" or "gentlemen's estates" on which agricultural activity is nonexistent, negligible, or inauthentic.  The legislature intends that this Act promote actual agricultural activity on lots in agricultural districts and make agricultural land more available and affordable to farmers and agribusinesses.
     The purposes of this Act are to:
     (1)  Establish a maximum floor area for a farm dwelling on a lot in an agricultural district; and
     (2)  Increase the minimum lot size in an agricultural district.
     SECTION 2.  Section 205-4.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  Within the agricultural district, all lands with soil classified by the land study bureau's detailed land classification as overall (master) productivity rating class A or B shall be restricted to the following permitted uses:
     (1)  Cultivation of crops, including crops for bioenergy, flowers, vegetables, foliage, fruits, forage, and timber;
     (2)  Game and fish propagation;
     (3)  Raising of livestock, including poultry, bees, fish, or other animal or aquatic life that are propagated for economic or personal use;
     (4)  Farm dwellings, employee housing, farm buildings, or activities or uses related to farming and animal husbandry.  "Farm dwelling", as used in this paragraph, means a single-family dwelling located on and used in connection with a farm, including clusters of single-family farm dwellings permitted within agricultural parks developed by the State, or where agricultural activity provides income to the family occupying the dwelling[;].  A farm dwelling that has received final governmental approval for construction after June 30, 2011, shall have a floor area not greater than two thousand square feet.  "Floor area" means the area of all floors under roof of a farm dwelling, measured from the exterior faces of the exterior walls of the dwelling.  "Floor area" includes the area under roof of any basement or any attic not less than seven feet in height.  The land use commission may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to further define "floor area" consistent with this paragraph;
     (5)  Public institutions and buildings that are necessary for agricultural practices;
     (6)  Public and private open area types of recreational uses, including day camps, picnic grounds, parks, and riding stables, but not including dragstrips, airports, drive-in theaters, golf courses, golf driving ranges, country clubs, and overnight camps;
     (7)  Public, private, and quasi-public utility lines and roadways, transformer stations, communications equipment buildings, solid waste transfer stations, major water storage tanks, and appurtenant small buildings such as booster pumping stations, but not including offices or yards for equipment, material, vehicle storage, repair or maintenance, treatment plants, corporation yards, or other similar structures;
     (8)  Retention, restoration, rehabilitation, or improvement of buildings or sites of historic or scenic interest;
     (9)  Roadside stands for the sale of agricultural products grown on the premises;
    (10)  Buildings and uses, including mills, storage, and processing facilities, maintenance facilities, and vehicle and equipment storage areas that are normally considered directly accessory to the above-mentioned uses and are permitted under section 205-2(d);

         (A)  The employee housing is occupied by employees or former employees of the plantation who have a property interest in the land;
         (B)  The employee housing units not owned by their occupants shall be rented or leased at affordable rates for agricultural workers; or
         (C)  The agricultural support buildings shall be rented or leased to agricultural business operators or agricultural support services;
    (13)  Agricultural tourism conducted on a working farm, or a farming operation as defined in section 165-2, for the enjoyment, education, or involvement of visitors; provided that the agricultural tourism activity is accessory and secondary to the principal agricultural use and does not interfere with surrounding farm operations; and provided further that this paragraph shall apply only to a county that has adopted ordinances regulating agricultural tourism under section 205-5;
    (14)  Wind energy facilities, including the appurtenances associated with the production and transmission of wind generated energy; provided that the wind energy facilities and appurtenances are compatible with agriculture uses and cause minimal adverse impact on agricultural land;
