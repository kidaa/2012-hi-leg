A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HOME CARE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  In the regular session of 2009, the legislature passed S.B. No. 415, S.D. 2, H.D. 1, C.D. 1, which was enacted as Act 21 in the first special session of 2009.  The purpose of Act 21 is to ensure that home care agencies meet minimum standards when delivering services to clients by requiring these agencies to be licensed.  The Act designates the department of health as the licensing agency.  The department has collaborated with home care agencies, consumer advocates, and other stakeholders to draft the administrative rules needed to implement licensing.  Those draft rules are in the last stage of the approval process.
     The department of health intends that licensing fees charged to home care agencies will cover the administrative costs associated with licensing.  However, initial funding is needed to start the licensing process so that fees can be collected.  After the first year, licensing fees will cover the administrative costs of licensing.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $         or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 for staffing and other costs associated with the licensing of home care agencies.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of health for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
