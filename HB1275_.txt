TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO AGRICULTURE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Supporting Hawaii agriculture assists hard-working local farmers and helps preserve agricultural jobs.  It is estimated that eighty-five per cent of the State's consumer goods are imported.  Raising the level of Hawaii's food self-sufficiency increases the State's food security by protecting against transportation disruptions.  Buying local also keeps money flowing through the State, directly and indirectly supporting the State's residents.
     Established as a Hawaii nonprofit corporation in 2009, 4 Ag Hawaii is a collaborative private-public sector partnership focused on sustainable agricultural economic developments.  The partnership is committed to raising the awareness of the importance of agriculture and expanding the agricultural industry in Hawaii.  The 4 Ag Hawaii partnership instituted the "Buy Local, It Matters" slogan campaign, which aims to encourage residents to support Hawaii farmers by making conscious decisions to purchase locally produced agricultural products.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds to 4 Ag Hawaii to expand its statewide program for all segments of Hawaii's agriculture, which will serve a public purpose by helping the State move towards improved food security.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $500,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 as a grant pursuant to chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to the 4 Ag Hawaii nonprofit corporation to enhance the "Buy Local, It Matters" campaign through:
     (1)  Expanded print, television, and radio media exposure; and
     (2)  Participation with the Hawaii tourism authority, Hawaii visitors and convention bureau, Hawaii Restaurant Association, and necessary county private and public agricultural organizations.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of agriculture for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
