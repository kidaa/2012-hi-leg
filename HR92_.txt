HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DIRECTORS OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO ADOPT ADMINISTRATIVE RULES THAT REQUIRE CARE HOME OPERATORS IN THE STATE TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN LIABILITY INSURANCE.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, in Hawaii, several types of long term-residential care facilities are available for elderly persons and persons with disabilities; and
 
     WHEREAS, these facilities include adult foster homes, adult residential care homes, assisted living facilities, expanded adult residential care homes, and community care foster family homes; and
 
     WHEREAS, many care home facilities are designed to serve persons who do not require full-time nursing care, but are unable to live independently; and
 
     WHEREAS, care home facilities in Hawaii typically provide a room, together with meals, housekeeping, and laundry service; and depending on the needs of the resident, the care home facilities may also provide assistance with daily activities such as personal hygiene, dressing, eating, and walking; and
 
     WHEREAS, care home facilities are not considered to be medical facilities, but they are an important part of the human services and care infrastructure in Hawaii, and as such, they are required to meet certain standards for care and safety; and
 
     WHEREAS, maintaining sufficient liability insurance is crucial to operating a safe care home as it provides protection for the residents of the care home, care home operators, and community in which the care home is located; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Directors of Health  Human Services, as applicable, are requested to adopt administrative rules, pursuant to Chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, that require operators of adult foster homes, adult residential care homes, assisted living facilities, expanded adult residential care homes, and community care foster family homes in the State to obtain and maintain liability insurance in coverage amounts deemed sufficient by the Director of Health or the Director of Human Services, as appropriate; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Directors of Health and Human Services.
