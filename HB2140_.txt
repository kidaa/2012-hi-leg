STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO CHILD PROTECTION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Chapter 587A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§587A‑    Child to remain in family home; circumstance.  (a)  If a report regarding child abuse or neglect, or suspected child abuse or neglect, is filed pursuant to section 350-1.1, the child subject of the report shall be allowed to remain in the family home if it is more likely than not that the child will be safe from harm in the family home.  To make the family home safe for the child so that the child may remain in the family home, the perpetrator of the abuse on the child shall be ordered by the department or the court, as applicable, to leave the home and to seek treatment services.
     (b)  This section shall not serve as a basis for any civil action or criminal proceeding against the State or its employees or agents for any physical harm to the child from the perpetrator of the abuse which occurs in the family home if the child remains in the family home."
     SECTION 2.  Section 587A-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "[[]§587A-2[]]  Purpose; construction.  This chapter creates within the jurisdiction of the family court a child protective act to make paramount the safety and health of children who have been harmed or are in life circumstances that threaten harm.  Furthermore, this chapter makes provisions for the service, treatment, and permanent plans for these children and their families.
     The legislature finds that children deserve and require competent, responsible parenting and safe, secure, loving, and nurturing homes.  The legislature finds that children who have been harmed or are threatened with harm are less likely than other children to realize their full educational, vocational, and emotional potential, and become law-abiding, productive, self-sufficient citizens, and are more likely to become involved with the mental health system, the juvenile justice system, or the criminal justice system, as well as become an economic burden on the State.  The legislature finds that prompt identification, reporting, investigation, services, treatment, adjudication, and disposition of cases involving children who have been harmed or are threatened with harm are in the children's, their families', and society's best interests because the children are defenseless, exploitable, and vulnerable.  The legislature recognizes that many relatives are willing and able to provide a nurturing and safe placement for children who have been harmed or are threatened with harm.
     The policy and purpose of this chapter is to provide children with prompt and ample protection from the harms detailed herein, with an opportunity for timely reconciliation with their families if the families can provide safe family homes, and with timely and appropriate service or permanent plans to ensure the safety of the child so they may develop and mature into responsible, self-sufficient, law-abiding citizens.
     The service plan shall effectuate the child's remaining in the family home, when the family home can be immediately made safe with services, [or] the child's returning to a safe family home[.], or, when appropriate, removing a perpetrator of abuse or harm from an otherwise safe family home.  The service plan shall be carefully formulated with the family in a timely manner.  Every reasonable opportunity should be provided to help the child's legal custodian to succeed in remedying the problems that put the child at substantial risk of being harmed in the family home.  Each appropriate resource, public and private, family and friend, should be considered and used to maximize the legal custodian's potential for providing a safe family home for the child.  Full and careful consideration shall be given to the religious, cultural, and ethnic values of the child's legal custodian when service plans are being discussed and formulated.  Where the court has determined, by clear and convincing evidence, that the child cannot be returned to a safe family home, the child shall be permanently placed in a timely manner.
     The policy and purpose of this chapter includes the protection of children who have been harmed or are threatened with harm by:
     (1)  Providing assistance to families to address the causes for abuse and neglect;
     (2)  Respecting and using each family's strengths, resources, culture, and customs;
     (3)  Ensuring that families are meaningfully engaged and children are consulted in an age-appropriate manner in case planning;
     (4)  Enlisting the early and appropriate participation of family and the family's support networks;
     (5)  Respecting and encouraging the input and views of caregivers; [and]
     (6)  Ensuring a permanent home through timely adoption or other permanent living arrangement, if safe reunification with the family is not possible[.]; and
     (7)  Requiring the perpetrator of abuse of a child, rather than the abused child, to leave an otherwise safe family home in certain cases.
     The child protective services under this chapter shall be provided with every reasonable effort to be open, accessible, and communicative to the persons affected by a child protective proceeding without endangering the safety and best interests of the child under this chapter.
     This chapter shall be liberally construed to serve the best interests of the children affected and the purpose and policies set forth herein."
     SECTION 3.  Section 587A-7, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  The following factors shall be fully considered when determining whether a child's family is willing and able to provide the child with a safe family home:

     (9)  Whether any non-perpetrator who resides in the family home has demonstrated an ability to protect the child from further harm and to ensure that any current protective orders are enforced;
    (10)  Whether there is a support system available to the child's family, including adoptive and hanai relatives, friends, and faith-based or other community networks;
    (11)  Attempts to locate and involve extended family, friends, and faith-based or other community networks;
    (12)  Whether the child's family has demonstrated an understanding of and involvement in services that have been recommended by the department or court-ordered as necessary to provide a safe family home for the child;
    (13)  Whether the child's family has resolved identified safety issues in the family home within a reasonable period of time; and
    (14)  The department's assessment, which shall include the demonstrated ability of the child's family to provide a safe family home for the child, and recommendations[.]; provided that preference shall be given to allowing the child to remain in the family home if it is more likely than not that the child will be safe from harm in the family home."

     (4)  Close the matter if the department finds, after an assessment, that the child is residing with a caregiver who is willing and able to meet the child's needs and provide a safe and appropriate placement for the child; provided that preference shall be given to allowing the child to remain in the family home if it is more likely than not that the child will be safe from harm in the family home;
     (5)  Immediately enter into a service plan:
         (A)  To safely maintain the child in the family home; or
         (B)  To place the child in voluntary foster care pursuant to a written agreement with the child's parent[.];
          provided that preference shall be given to allowing the child to remain in the family home if it is more likely than not that the child will be safe from harm in the family home.
               If the child is placed in voluntary foster care and the family does not successfully complete the service plan within three months after the date on which the department assumed physical custody of the child, the department shall file a petition.  The department is not required to file a petition if the parents agree to adoption or legal guardianship of the child and the child's safety is ensured; provided that the adoption or legal guardianship hearing is conducted within six months of the date on which the department assumed physical custody of the child;

         (B)  If jurisdiction has been established, a periodic review hearing within ten days of the child's placement.
