TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO TAXATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The purpose of this Act is to adopt changes to Hawaii's tax law that will allow Hawaii to participate in the national streamlined sales and use tax agreement.  This agreement simplifies state tax systems, removes burdens to interstate commerce that are defined in the United States Supreme Court decision in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), and "levels the playing field" between local and out-of-state retailers.  At its core, the Streamlined Sales Tax Project uses technology to accurately identify tax rates, collect taxes, and remit state tax revenues.  Since 2005, out‑of-state retailers have voluntarily collected and remitted over $350,000,000 in taxes to participating states that would have otherwise likely gone uncollected by the states.
     Hawaii's use tax, chapter 238, Hawaii Revised Statutes, has been on the books for over forty years and is similar to use tax laws in forty-five other states.  Most Hawaii consumers do not realize that they owe the State a four per cent tax on their out-of-state purchases via catalog, direct mail, or the Internet, and it is virtually impossible for the department of taxation to calculate and collect what individual taxpayers owe on those purchases.
     In 2003, the State of Hawaii became a participant in the national Streamlined Sales Tax Project by enacting the Hawaii Simplified Sales and Use Tax Administration Act (Act 173, Session Laws of Hawaii 2003).
     In 2005, to advance the State's efforts to comply with the terms and conditions of the conforming legislation reflected in the Streamlined Sales Tax Project's model agreement and act, the legislature enacted Act 3, Special Session Laws of Hawaii 2005.  Act 3 also established a technical advisory group to assist the department of taxation in identifying and resolving issues necessary for Streamlined Sales Tax Project compliance.  A joint house-senate legislative oversight committee was formed to provide additional tax policy support and guidance.
     During the 2006-2008 legislative sessions, legislation was introduced to implement conforming amendments to Hawaii's tax laws to implement the streamlined sales and use tax agreement in Hawaii.  In 2009, the legislature adopted streamlined sales and use tax legislation that was subsequently vetoed by the administration (Governor's Message 835, July 15, 2009).  The 2010 legislation was a culmination of prior efforts to adopt conforming legislation for the State to participate in and become a full member of the Streamlined Sales Tax Project.  This Act will finally allow the State to begin collecting use taxes that currently exist under chapter 238, Hawaii Revised Statutes, which are presently going uncollected on the majority of out-of-state purchases.
     To participate and become a full member in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, Hawaii must amend its tax law to be in conformity with the streamlined sales and use tax agreement.  The State must also adopt a single rate of general excise tax, Hawaii's substitute for a sales tax, to conform to the streamlined sales and use tax agreement.  In accordance with advice received from the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board and COST, a national organization representing businesses, this was accomplished by:
     (1)  Moving the one-half of one per cent tax rate for wholesale transactions to a new chapter;
     (2)  Adding a new chapter on the taxation of imports of property, services, and contracting;
     (3)  Moving the 0.15 per cent tax on insurance producers to a new chapter; and
     (4)  Eliminating the tax on businesses owned by disabled persons.
This Act also provides for destination-based sourcing and amnesty.
     The contents of this Act are updated to reflect the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board's amendments to the streamlined sales and use tax agreement through 2009.  The State of Hawaii would benefit tremendously by adopting legislation that would enable the State to be in compliance with the streamlined sales and use tax agreement at the same time that federal legislation is being re-introduced in 2011.
     SECTION 2.  The Hawaii Revised Statutes is amended by adding a new chapter to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:

     §A-6  Imposition of tax.  (a)  There is hereby levied and shall be assessed and collected annually privilege taxes against persons on account of their business and other activities in the State measured by the application of rates against values of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income, whichever is specified, as follows:
     (1)  Tax on manufacturers:
         (A)  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the State in the business of manufacturing, including compounding, canning, preserving, packing, printing, publishing, milling, processing, refining, or preparing for sale, profit, or commercial use, either directly or through the activity of others, in whole or in part, any article or articles, substance or substances, commodity or commodities, the amount of the tax to be equal to the value of the articles, substances, or commodities, manufactured, compounded, canned, preserved, packed, printed, milled, processed, refined, or prepared for sale, as shown by the gross proceeds derived from the sale thereof by the manufacturer or person compounding, preparing, or printing them, multiplied by one-half of one per cent;
         (B)  The measure of the tax on manufacturers is the value of the entire product for sale, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the State; and
         (C)  If any person liable for the tax on manufacturers ships or transports the person's product, or any part thereof, out of the State, whether in a finished or unfinished condition, or sells the same for delivery to points outside the State (for example, consigned to a mainland purchaser via common carrier f.o.b. Honolulu), the value of the products in the condition or form in which they exist immediately before entering interstate or foreign commerce, determined as hereinafter provided, shall be the basis for the assessment of the tax imposed by this paragraph.  This tax shall be due and payable as of the date of entry of the products into interstate or foreign commerce, whether the products are then sold or not.  The department shall determine the basis for assessment, as provided by this paragraph, as follows:
              (i)  If the products at the time of their entry into interstate or foreign commerce already have been sold, the gross proceeds of sale, less the transportation expenses, if any, incurred in realizing the gross proceeds for transportation from the time of entry of the products into interstate or foreign commerce, including insurance and storage in transit, shall be the measure of the value of the products;
             (ii)  If the products have not been sold at the time of their entry into interstate or foreign commerce, and in cases governed by clause (i) in which the products are sold under circumstances such that the gross proceeds of sale are not indicative of the true value of the products, the value of the products constituting the basis for assessment shall correspond as nearly as possible to the gross proceeds of sales for delivery outside the State, adjusted as provided in clause (i) or, if sufficient data is not available, sales in the State of similar products of like quality and character and in similar quantities, made by the taxpayer (unless not indicative of the true value), or by others.  Sales outside the State, adjusted as provided in clause (i), may be considered when they constitute the best available data.  The department shall prescribe uniform and equitable rules for ascertaining the values;
            (iii)  At the election of the taxpayer and with the approval of the department, the taxpayer may make the taxpayer's returns under clause (i) even though the products have not been sold at the time of their entry into interstate or foreign commerce; and
             (iv)  In all cases in which products leave the State in an unfinished condition, the basis for assessment shall be adjusted so as to deduct the portion of the value as is attributable to the finishing of the goods outside the State;
     (2)  Tax on producers.  Upon every person engaging or continuing within this State in the business of a producer, the tax shall be equal to one-half of one per cent of the gross proceeds of sales of the business, or the value of the products, for sale, if sold for delivery outside the State or shipped or transported out of the State, and the value of the products shall be determined in the same manner as the value of manufactured products covered in the cases under paragraph (1)(C).  No manufacturer or producer, engaged in the business of manufacturing or producing in the State and selling the manufacturer's or producer's products for delivery outside of the State (for example, consigned to a mainland purchaser via common carrier f.o.b. Honolulu), shall be required to pay the tax imposed in this chapter for the privilege of so selling the products, and the value or gross proceeds of sales of the products shall be included only in determining the measure of the tax imposed upon the manufacturer or producer;
     (3)  Tax on theaters, amusements, radio broadcasting stations, etc.  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the State in the business of operating a theater, opera house, moving picture show, vaudeville, amusement park, dance hall, skating rink, radio broadcasting station, or any other place at which amusements are offered to the public, at wholesale, the tax shall be one-half of one per cent of the gross proceeds of the business;
     (4)  Tax on service business.  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the State in any service business or calling including professional services not otherwise specifically taxed under this chapter, as a wholesaler under section A-2, the tax shall be equal to one-half of one per cent of the gross proceeds of the business;
     (5)  Tax on sales by wholesalers:
         (A)  Upon every person who is engaged in the business of a wholesaler or jobber under section A-2 or selling any tangible personal property whatsoever (not including, however, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, or stocks), there is hereby levied, and shall be assessed and collected, a tax equivalent to one-half of one per cent of the gross proceeds of sales of the business as a wholesaler or jobber as defined in section A‑2; and
         (B)  Gross proceeds of sales of tangible property in interstate and foreign commerce shall constitute a part of the measure of the tax imposed on persons in the business of selling tangible personal property as a wholesaler, to the extent, under the conditions, and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and the Acts of Congress of the United States that may be now in force or may be hereafter adopted, and whenever there occurs in the State an activity to which, under the Constitution and Acts of Congress, there may be attributed gross proceeds of sales, the gross proceeds shall be so attributed.
     (b)  When a manufacturer or producer, engaged in business in the State, also is engaged in selling the manufacturer's or producer's products in the State at wholesale taxed under this chapter, retail under chapter 237, or in any other manner, the tax for the privilege of engaging in the business of selling the products in the State shall apply to the manufacturer or producer as well as the tax for the privilege of manufacturing or producing in the State, and the manufacturer or producer shall make the returns of the gross proceeds of the wholesale, retail under chapter 237, or other sales required for the privilege of selling in the State, as well as making the returns of the value or gross proceeds of sales of the products required for the privilege of manufacturing or producing in the State.  The manufacturer or producer shall pay the tax imposed in this chapter for the privilege of selling its products in the State, and the value or gross proceeds of sales of the products, thus subjected to tax, may be deducted insofar as duplicated as to the same products by the measure of the tax upon the manufacturer or producer for the privilege of manufacturing or producing in the State under this chapter; provided that no producer of agricultural products who sells the products to a purchaser who will process the products outside the State shall be required to pay the tax imposed in this chapter for the privilege of producing or selling those products.
     §A-7  Resale certificates.  (a)  The department, by rule, may require that a seller take from the purchaser of tangible personal property a certificate, in a form prescribed by the department, certifying that the sale is a sale at wholesale; provided that:
     (1)  Any purchaser who furnishes a certificate shall be obligated to pay to the seller, upon demand, the amount of the additional tax that is imposed upon the seller whenever the sale in fact is not at wholesale; and
     (2)  The absence of a certificate in itself shall give rise to the presumption that the sale is not at wholesale unless the sales of the business are exclusively at wholesale.
     (b)  The department may require that the person rendering an amusement at wholesale take from the licensed seller a certificate, in a form prescribed by the department, certifying that the sale is a sale at wholesale; provided that:
     (1)  Any licensed seller who furnishes a certificate shall be obligated to pay to the person rendering the amusement, upon demand, the amount of additional tax that is imposed upon the seller whenever the sale is not at wholesale; and
     (2)  The absence of a certificate in itself shall give rise to the presumption that the sale is not at wholesale unless the person rendering the sale is exclusively rendering the amusement at wholesale.
     (c)  The department may require that the person rendering a service at wholesale take from the licensed seller a certificate, in a form prescribed by the department, certifying that the sale is a sale at wholesale; provided that:
     (1)  Any licensed seller who furnishes a certificate shall be obligated to pay to the person rendering the service, upon demand, the amount of additional tax that is imposed upon the seller whenever the sale is not at wholesale; and
     (2)  The absence of a certificate in itself shall give rise to the presumption that the sale is not at wholesale, unless the person rendering the sale is exclusively rendering services at wholesale.
     §A-8  Tax on receipts of sugar benefit payments.  Upon the amounts received from the United States government by any producer of sugar (or the producer's legal representative or heirs), as defined under and by virtue of the Sugar Act of 1948, as amended, or other Acts of the Congress of the United States relating thereto, there is hereby levied a tax of one-half of one per cent of the gross amount received; provided that the tax levied hereunder on any amount so received and actually disbursed to another by a producer in the form of a benefit payment shall be paid by the person or persons to whom the amount is actually disbursed, and the producer actually making a benefit payment to another shall be entitled to claim on the producer's return a deduction from the gross amount taxable hereunder in the sum of the amount so disbursed.  The amounts taxed under this section shall not be taxable under any other paragraph, subsection, or section of this chapter or chapter 237.
     §A-9  Segregation of gross income, etc., on records and in returns.  The imposition of taxes and the application of tax rates do not depend upon the business in which the taxpayer is primarily engaged.  One business may be subject to two or more tax rates under this chapter and chapter 237.  If a business is within the purview of two or more of the paragraphs of section 237-13 or other provisions of this chapter or chapter 237, all of them apply, each provision being applicable to the appropriate item of gross income, gross proceeds of sales, or value of products.  However, any person engaging or continuing in a business having gross income, gross proceeds of sales, and value of products, or any of these as the case may be, taxable at different rates, shall be subject to taxation upon the aggregate amount of the gross income, gross proceeds of sales, and value of products of the business at the highest rate applicable to any part of the aggregate, unless the person shall segregate the parts taxable at different rates upon the person's records and in the person's returns, and shall sustain the burden of proving that the segregation was correctly made.
     §A-10  Assessment on generated electricity.  Any other provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the levy and assessment of tax on the gross proceeds from the sale of electric power to a public utility company for resale to the public, shall be made only as a tax on business of a producer, at the rate assessed producers under section A-6(a)(2).
     §A-11  Technicians.  When technicians supply dentists or physicians with dentures, orthodontic devices, braces, and similar items that have been prepared by the technician in accordance with specifications furnished by the dentist or physician, and these items are to be used by the dentist or physician in the dentist's or physician's professional practice for a particular patient who is to pay the dentist or physician for the same as a part of the dentist's or physician's professional services, the technician shall be taxed as though the technician were a manufacturer selling a product under A‑6(a)(1) to a licensed retailer, rather than pursuant to chapter 237, at the rate of four per cent that is generally applied to professions and services.
     §A-12  Activity ordered by others.  (a)  Where, through the activity of a person taxable under section 237-13(5), a product has been milled, processed, or otherwise manufactured upon the order of another taxpayer who is a manufacturer taxable upon the value of the entire manufactured products, which consists in part of the value of the services taxable under section 237‑13(5), so much gross income as is derived from the rendering of the services shall be subjected to tax on the person rendering the services at the rate of one-half of one per cent, and the value of the entire product shall be included in the measure of the tax imposed on the other taxpayer as elsewhere provided.
     (b)  Where, through the activity of a person taxable under section 237-13(5), there have been rendered to a cane planter services consisting in the harvesting or hauling of the cane, or consisting in road maintenance, under a contract between the person rendering the services and the cane planter, covering the services and also the milling of the sugar, the services of harvesting and hauling the cane and road maintenance shall be treated the same as the service of milling the cane, as provided by subsection (a), and the value of the entire product, manufactured or sold for the cane planter under the contract, shall be included in the measure of the tax imposed on the persons as elsewhere provided.
     §A-13  Sales of telecommunications services through prepaid telephone calling service.  (a)  For the purposes of this section, "prepaid telephone calling service" means the right to exclusively purchase telecommunications services, paid for in advance, that enables the origination of calls using an access number or authorization code, whether manually or electronically dialed.
     (b)  If the sale or recharge of a prepaid telephone calling service does not take place at the vendor's place of business, it shall be conclusively determined to take place at the customer's shipping address; or if there is no item shipped, then it shall be the customer's billing address.
     (c)  When a person licensed under this chapter sells prepaid telephone calling services to a licensed retail merchant, jobber, or other licensed seller for purposes of resale, the person shall be taxed as a wholesaler selling tangible personal property.
     (d)  For purposes of prepaid telephone calling services only, all such services shall be taxed under this section and shall be in lieu of taxation under chapter 239.
     §A-14  Apportionment.  In the case of a tax upon the production of property in the State, the apportionment shall be determined as in the case of the tax on manufacturers provided in section A-6(a)(1).
     §A-15  Conformity to Constitution.  Section 237-22 shall apply to this chapter.
     §A-16  Exemptions.  The exemptions provided in sections 237‑23, 237-26, 237-27, 237-27.5, 237-29, 237-29.5, and 237‑29.53 shall apply to this chapter.
     §A-17  Amounts not taxable.  This chapter shall not apply to the following amounts:
     (1)  The amounts of taxes on cigarettes and tobacco products imposed by chapter 245 on wholesalers or dealers holding licenses under that chapter and selling the products at wholesale;
     (2)  The amounts of federal taxes imposed on sugar manufactured in the State, paid by the manufacturer to the federal government;
     (3)  Gross income received by any blind, deaf, or totally disabled person engaging, or continuing, in any business, trade, activity, occupation, or calling within the State; a corporation all of whose outstanding shares are owned by an individual or individuals who are blind, deaf, or totally disabled; a general, limited, or limited liability partnership, all of whose partners are blind, deaf, or totally disabled; or a limited liability company, all of whose members are blind, deaf, or totally disabled; and
     (4)  Amounts received by a producer of sugarcane from the manufacturer to whom the producer sells the sugarcane, where:
         (A)  The producer is an independent cane farmer, so classed by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Sugar Act of 1948 (61 Stat. 922, Chapter 519) as the Act may be amended or supplemented;
         (B)  The value or gross proceeds of sale of the sugar, and other products manufactured from the sugarcane, is included in the measure of the tax levied on the manufacturer under section A‑6(a)(1);
         (C)  The producer's gross proceeds of sales are dependent upon the actual value of the products manufactured therefrom or the average value of all similar products manufactured by the manufacturer; and
         (D)  The producer's gross proceeds of sales are reduced by reason of the tax on the value or sale of the manufactured products.
     §A-18  Exemption for sale of tangible personal property for resale at wholesale.  (a)  There shall be exempted from, and excluded from the measure of, the taxes imposed by this chapter all of the gross proceeds or gross income arising from the sale of tangible personal property imported to Hawaii from a foreign or domestic source to a licensed taxpayer for subsequent resale for the purpose of sale at wholesale as defined under section A‑2.
     (b)  The department, by rule, may provide that a seller may take from the purchaser of imported tangible personal property, a certificate in a form that the department shall prescribe, certifying that the purchaser of the imported tangible personal property shall resell the imported tangible personal property at wholesale as defined under section A‑2.  Any purchaser who furnishes a certificate shall be obligated to pay to the seller, upon demand, if the sale in fact is not a sale for the purpose of resale at wholesale, the amount of the additional tax that is imposed upon the seller.  The absence of a certificate, unless the sales of the business are exclusively a sale for the purpose of resale at wholesale, in itself, shall give rise to the presumption that the sale is not a sale for the purpose of resale at wholesale.

     "Air-to-ground radiotelephone service" means a radio service, as that term is defined in 47 C.F.R. 22.99, in which common carriers are authorized to offer and provide radio telecommunications service for hire to subscribers in aircraft.
     "Call-by-call basis" means any method of charging for telecommunications services where the price is measured by individual calls.
     "Communications channel" means a physical or virtual path of communications over which signals are transmitted between or among customer channel termination points.
     "Customer":
     (1)  Means the person or entity that contracts with the seller of telecommunications services.  For the purpose of sourcing sales of telecommunications services under section 237-C, the end user of telecommunications services is not the contracting party, the end user of the telecommunications service is the customer of the telecommunications service; and
     (2)  Does not include a reseller of telecommunications service or for mobile telecommunications service of a serving carrier under an agreement to serve the customer outside the home service provider's licensed service area.
     "Customer channel termination point" means the location where the customer either inputs or receives the communications.
     "End user" means the person who utilizes the telecommunications service.  In the case of an entity, "end user" means the individual who utilizes the service on behalf of the entity.
     "Home service provider" has the same meaning as that term is defined in section 124(5) of Public Law 106-252 (Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act).
     "Mobile telecommunications service" has the same meaning as that term is defined in section 124(7) of Public Law 106-252 (Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act).
     "Place of primary use" means the street address representative of where the customer's use of the telecommunications service primarily occurs, which shall be the residential street address or the primary business street address of the customer.  In the case of mobile telecommunications services, "place of primary use" shall be within the licensed service area of the home service provider.
     "Post-paid calling service" means the telecommunications service obtained by making a payment on a call-by-call basis either through the use of a credit card or payment mechanism such as a bank card, travel card, or debit card, or by charge made to a telephone number that is not associated with the origination or termination of the telecommunications service.  A post-paid calling service includes a telecommunications service, except a prepaid wireless calling service, which would be a prepaid calling service except it is not exclusively a telecommunications service.
     "Prepaid calling service" means the right to access exclusively telecommunications services that must be paid in advance and that enables the origination of calls using an access number or authorization code, whether manually or electronically dialed, and is sold in predetermined units or dollars of which the number declines with use in a known amount.
     "Prepaid wireless calling service" means a telecommunications service that provides the right to utilize mobile wireless service as well as other non-telecommunications services, including the download of digital products delivered electronically, and content and ancillary services, which must be paid for in advance and is sold in predetermined units or dollars of which the number declines with use in a known amount.
     "Private communication service" means a telecommunications service that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels between or among termination points, regardless of the manner in which the channel or channels are connected, and includes switching capacity, extension lines, stations, and any other associated services that are provided in connection with the use of the channel or channels.
     "Service address" means:
     (1)  The location of the telecommunications equipment to which a customer's call is charged and from which the call originates or terminates, regardless of where the call is billed or paid;
     (2)  If the location in paragraph (1) is not known, service address means the origination point of the signal of the telecommunications service first identified by either the seller's telecommunications system or in information received by the seller from its service provider, where the system used to transport the signals is not that of the seller; or
     (3)  If the location in paragraphs (1) and (2) is not known, service address means the location of the customer's place of primary use.
     §237-E  Deduction for bad debts.  (a)  A seller shall be allowed a deduction from taxable sales for bad debts.  A seller may deduct the amount of bad debts from the seller's gross sales, rentals, or services used for the computation of the tax.  The amount of gross sales, rentals, or services deducted shall be charged off as uncollectible on the books and records of the seller at the time the debt becomes worthless and deducted on the return for the period during which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and shall be eligible to be deducted for income tax purposes.
     For the purposes of this section, a claimant who is not required to file a federal income tax return may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which the bad debt becomes worthless and is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax return.
     If a consumer or other person pays all or part of a bad debt with respect to which a seller claimed a deduction under this section, the seller is liable for the amount of taxes deducted in connection with that portion of the debt for which payment is received and shall remit these taxes in the seller's next payment to the department.  Any payments made on a bad debt shall be applied proportionally first to the taxable price of the property and the tax on the property and second to any interest, service, or other charge.
     (b)  Any claim for a bad debt deduction under this section shall be supported by evidence required by the department.  The department shall review any change in the rate of taxation applicable to any taxable sales, rentals, or services by a seller claiming a deduction pursuant to this section and shall ensure that the deduction on any bad debt does not result in the seller claiming the deduction recovering any more or less than the taxes imposed on the sale, rental, or service that constitutes the bad debt.
     (c)  If a certified service provider assumed filing responsibility under chapter 255D, the certified service provider may claim, on behalf of the seller, any bad debt allowable to the seller and shall credit or refund that amount of bad debt allowed or refunded to the seller.
     (d)  If the books and records of a seller under chapter 255D, who claims a bad debt allowance, support an allocation of the bad debts among member states of that agreement, the seller may allocate the bad debt.
     (e)  As used in this section, "bad debt" means any portion of a debt resulting from a seller's collection of the use tax under chapter 255D on the purchase of tangible personal property or services that is not otherwise deductible or excludable and is eligible to be claimed, or could be eligible to be claimed if the seller kept accounts on an accrual basis, as a deduction pursuant to section 166 (with respect to bad debts) of the Internal Revenue Code.  A bad debt does not include any of the following:
     (1)  Interest, finance charge, or use tax on the purchase price;
     (2)  Uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the seller until the full purchase price is paid;
     (3)  Expenses incurred in attempting to collect any account receivable or any portion of the debt recovered;
     (4)  Any accounts receivable that have been sold to and remain in the possession of a third party for collection; or
     (5)  Repossessed property.
     §237-F  Direct mail sourcing.  (a)  Notwithstanding the general sourcing provisions of section 237-A, a purchaser of direct mail who is not a holder of a direct pay permit shall provide to the seller, in conjunction with the purchase, either a direct mail form or information to show the jurisdictions to which the direct mail is delivered to recipients.
     Upon receipt of the direct mail form, the seller shall be relieved of all obligations to collect, pay, or remit the applicable tax and the purchaser shall be obligated to pay or remit the applicable tax on a direct pay basis.  A direct mail form shall remain in effect for all future sales of direct mail by the seller to the purchaser until it is revoked in writing.
     Upon receipt of information from the purchaser showing the jurisdictions to which the direct mail is delivered to recipients, the seller shall collect the tax according to the delivery information provided by the purchaser.  In the absence of bad faith, the seller shall be relieved of any further obligation to collect tax on any transaction for which the seller has collected tax pursuant to the delivery information provided by the purchaser.
     (b)  If the purchaser of direct mail does not have a direct pay permit and does not provide the seller with either a direct mail form or delivery information as required under subsection (a), the seller shall collect the tax.  Nothing in this subsection shall limit a purchaser's obligation for sales or use tax to any state to which the direct mail is delivered.
     (c)  If a purchaser of direct mail provides the seller with documentation of direct pay authority, the purchaser shall not be required to provide a direct mail form or delivery information to the seller.
     (d)  Receipts from sales of direct mail for distribution to out‑of-state recipients and receipts from sales of direct mail processing services in connection with distribution of direct mail to out-of-state recipients shall be exempt from taxation under this chapter.  The exemption provided by this section shall apply to receipts from charges for the printing or production of direct mail, whether prepared in or shipped into Hawaii, after preparation, and stored for subsequent shipment to out-of-state customers.  The direct mail processing services exemption provided under this section shall apply to receipts from charges for all direct mail processing services for distribution to out-of-state recipients, including but not limited to preparing and maintaining mailing lists, addressing, separating, folding, inserting, sorting, and packaging direct mail materials, and transporting the direct mail to the point of shipment by the mail service or other carrier."
     SECTION 7.  Section 237-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding seven new definitions to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows:

     (2)  A percentage based on the total weight of the taxable property compared to the total weight of all property in the shipment.

     (2)  Includes tangible personal property supplied directly or indirectly by the purchaser to the direct mail seller for inclusion in the package containing the printed material; and

     "Purchase price" applies to the measure subject to use tax and has the same meaning as sales price.

     SECTION 8.  Chapter 239, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§239‑    Treatment of conflicts.  In a case where the tax under chapter 237 and this part may be applied to the same gross income or gross proceeds, the tax shall only be levied, assessed, and collected under chapter 237."
     SECTION 9.  Chapter 255D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding nine new sections to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§255D-A  Relief from certain liability.  All sellers and certified service providers as defined in section 255D-2 using databases pursuant to section 255D-D(f) and (g) shall be relieved from liability to the state and local jurisdictions for having charged and collected the incorrect amount of sales or use tax resulting from the seller or certified service provider relying on erroneous data provided by the State on tax rates, boundaries, or taxing jurisdiction assignments.
     §255D-B  Rounding rule.  For the purpose of calculating the amount of the sales or use tax:
     (1)  The tax computation shall be carried to the third decimal place; and
     (2)  The tax shall be rounded to a whole cent using a method that rounds up to the next cent whenever the third decimal place is greater than four.
     Sellers may elect to compute the tax due on a transaction on an item or an invoice basis, and shall allow the rounding rule to be applied to the aggregated state and local taxes.
     §255D-C  Amnesty for registration under this chapter.  (a)  The department shall provide amnesty for uncollected or unpaid sales tax under chapter 237 or use tax under chapter 238, including any county surcharge, to a seller who registers to pay or to collect and remit applicable sales or use tax on transactions made to purchasers in the State in accordance with the terms of the streamlined sales and use tax agreement; provided that the seller was not so registered in the State in the twelve-month period preceding the effective date of the State's participation in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement.
     (b)  The amnesty shall preclude assessment for uncollected or unpaid sales tax under chapter 237 or use tax under chapter 238 together with penalty or interest for sales made during the period the seller was not registered in the State; provided registration occurs within twelve months of the effective date of the State's participation in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement.
     (c)  The amnesty shall not be available to a seller with respect to any matter or matters for which the seller received notice of the commencement of an audit and the audit is not yet finally resolved including any related administrative and judicial processes.
     (d)  The amnesty shall not be available for sales or use taxes already paid or remitted to the State or to taxes collected by the seller.
     (e)  The amnesty shall be fully effective, absent the seller's fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact, as long as the seller continues registration and continues payment or collection and remittance of applicable sales or use taxes for a period of at least thirty-six months.  The statute of limitations is tolled with respect to asserting a tax liability during this thirty-six month period.
     (f)  The amnesty shall only apply to sales or use taxes due from a seller in its capacity as a seller and not to sales or use taxes due from a seller in its capacity as a buyer.
     §255D-D  Local rate and boundary changes.  (a)  Any rate changes by a local jurisdiction shall be effective only on the first day of a calendar quarter after a minimum of sixty days notice to sellers.
     (b)  Any local tax rate changes relating to purchases from printed catalogs wherein the purchaser computes the tax based upon local tax rates published in the catalog shall be effective only on the first day of a calendar quarter after a minimum of one hundred twenty days notice to sellers.
     (c)  For sales and use tax purposes only, local jurisdiction boundary changes apply only on the first day of a calendar quarter after a minimum of sixty days notice to sellers.
     (d)  The department shall provide and maintain a database that describes boundary changes for all taxing jurisdictions.  The database shall include a description of the change and the effective date of the change for sales tax under chapter 237 and use tax under chapter 238 purposes.
     (e)  The department shall provide and maintain a database of all sales tax rates under chapter 237 and use tax rates under chapter 238 for all of the jurisdictions levying taxes within the State.  For the identification of states, counties, and cities, codes corresponding to the rates shall be provided according to Federal Information Processing Standards as developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  For the identification of all other jurisdictions, codes corresponding to the rates shall be in the format determined by the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Incorporated.
     (f)  The department shall provide and maintain a database that assigns each five-digit and nine-digit zip code within the State to the proper tax rates and jurisdictions.  The department shall apply the lowest combined tax rate imposed in the zip code area if the area includes more than one tax rate in any level of taxing jurisdictions.  If a nine-digit zip code designation is not available for a street address or if a seller or certified service provider is unable to determine the nine-digit zip code designation of a purchaser after exercising due diligence to determine the designation, the seller or certified service provider may apply the rate for the five-digit zip code area.  For the purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a seller or certified service provider has exercised due diligence if the seller has attempted to determine the nine-digit zip code designation by utilizing software approved by the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Incorporated, that makes this designation from the street address and the five-digit zip code of the purchaser.
     (g)  The State shall participate with other states in the development of an address-based system for assigning taxing jurisdictions.  The system shall meet the requirements developed pursuant to the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. 116).  If any state develops an address-based assignment system pursuant to the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, a seller may use that system in place of the system provided for in subsection (e).
     §255D-E  Certified service provider; agent of the seller.  (a)  A certified service provider is the agent of a seller, with whom the certified service provider has contracted for the collection and remittance of sales and use taxes.  As the seller's agent, the certified service provider is liable for sales and use tax due to the State on all sales transactions it processes for the seller unless the seller made a material misrepresentation or committed fraud.
     (b)  A seller that uses a certified automated system is responsible and is liable to the State for reporting and remitting tax.
     §255D-F  Confidentiality of records.  (a)  Except as provided in subsection (c), a certified service provider shall not retain or disclose the personally identifiable information of consumers.  A certified service provider's system shall be designed and tested to ensure the privacy of consumers by protecting their anonymity.
     (b)  A certified service provider shall provide clear and conspicuous notice of its information practices to consumers, including but not limited to what information it collects, how it collects the information, how it uses the information, how long it retains the information, and whether it discloses the information to member states.
     (c)  A certified service provider's retention or disclosure to member states of personally identifiable information is limited to that required to ensure the validity of exemptions claimed because of a consumer's status or intended use of the goods or services purchased.
     (d)  A certified service provider shall provide the necessary technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to protect personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
     (e)  The privacy policy required under this section shall be subject to enforcement by the attorney general.
     (f)  If personally identifiable information is retained by the State for the purpose of subsection (c), in the absence of exigent circumstances, a person shall be afforded reasonable access to the person's own data, with a right to correct inaccurately recorded data.
     (g)  The agreement does not enlarge or limit the State's authority to do any of the following:
     (1)  Conduct audits or other reviews as provided under the agreement or the State's law;
     (2)  Provide records pursuant to chapter 92F, disclosure laws with governmental agencies, or other regulations;
     (3)  Prevent, consistent with the State's law, disclosures of confidential taxpayer information;
     (4)  Prevent, consistent with federal law, disclosures or misuse of federal return information obtained under a disclosure agreement with the Internal Revenue Service; or
     (5)  Collect, disclose, disseminate, or otherwise use anonymous data for governmental purposes.
     (h)  The department shall publish on the department's website the State's policy relating to the collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information obtained from a certified service provider under subsection (c).
     (i)  The department shall destroy personally identifiable information obtained from a certified service provider when the information is no longer required for purposes under subsection (c).
     (j)  If a person other than a member state or person authorized by a member state's law or the agreement seeks to discover personally identifiable information about an individual from the State, the department shall make a reasonable and timely effort to notify that individual of the request.
     (k)  As used in this section, "personally identifiable information" means information that identifies a specific person.
     §255D-G  Liability for uncollected tax.  (a)  A seller registered under the agreement is not liable for any uncollected or nonremitted tax on transactions with purchasers in the State before the date of registration, if the seller was not licensed or registered under chapter 237 in the twelve-month period preceding the effective date of the State's participation in the agreement.  The seller is also not responsible for any penalty or interest that may be due on those transactions.  This subsection applies only if the seller is registered in this State within twelve months of the effective date of this State's participation in the agreement.
     (b)  Subsection (a) does not apply to:
     (1)  Any tax liability of the registered seller for transactions that are subject to sales or use tax in the State in which the registered seller is the purchaser;
     (2)  Any sales or use taxes already paid or remitted to the State or to taxes collected by the seller; and
     (3)  Any transactions for which the seller received notice of the commencement of an audit and the audit is not finally resolved, including related administrative or judicial processes.
     (c)  Subsection (a) applies to the seller absent the seller's fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact, only if the seller continues to be registered under the agreement and continues collection and remittance of applicable sales and use taxes in the State for at least thirty‑six months.  The statute of limitations applicable to assessing a tax liability shall be tolled during the thirty-six-month period.
     §255D-H  Rate changes.  (a)  The department shall publish on its website a notification to sellers registered under the agreement of a change in tax rate or tax base within five business days of receiving notice of the changes to the tax rate or tax base or of an amendment to sales and use tax rules.  Whenever possible, a tax rate or tax base change should occur on the first day of a calendar quarter.
     (b)  The failure of a seller to receive notice under subsection (a) does not relieve the seller of its obligation to collect the sales or use tax.
     (c)  The department shall complete a taxability matrix as provided for under section 328 of the agreement, maintain it in a database in a downloadable format approved by the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Incorporated, and provide notice of changes in the matrix.
     §255D-I  Customer refund procedures.  A cause of action against a seller for overcollected sales or use taxes does not accrue until sixty days after a purchaser has provided written notice to the seller.  The purchaser shall provide sufficient information in the notice to determine the validity of the request.  In matters relating to the request, a seller is presumed to have a reasonable business practice if, in the collection of sales or use tax, the seller has a certified service provider or a system, including a proprietary system, certified by the department, and has remitted to this State all taxes collected, less any deductions, credits, or collection allowances."
     SECTION 10.  Section 237-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  "Gross income" means the gross receipts, cash or accrued, of the taxpayer received as compensation for personal services and the gross receipts of the taxpayer derived from trade, business, commerce, or sales and the value proceeding or accruing from the sale of tangible personal property, or service, or both, and all receipts, actual or accrued as hereinafter provided, by reason of the investment of the capital of the business engaged in, including interest, discount, rentals, royalties, fees, or other emoluments however designated and without any deductions on account of the cost of property sold, the cost of materials used, labor cost, taxes, royalties, interest, or discount paid or any other expenses whatsoever.  Every taxpayer shall be presumed to be dealing on a cash basis unless the taxpayer proves to the satisfaction of the department of taxation that the taxpayer is dealing on an accrual basis and the taxpayer's books are so kept, or unless the taxpayer employs or is required to employ the accrual basis for the purposes of the tax imposed by chapter 235 for any taxable year in which event the taxpayer shall report the taxpayer's gross income for the purposes of this chapter on the accrual basis for the same period.
     "Gross proceeds of sale" means the [value actually proceeding from the sale of tangible personal property without any deduction on account of the cost of property sold or expenses of any kind.] sales price."
     SECTION 11.  Section 237-8.6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  The county surcharge on state tax, upon the adoption of county ordinances and in accordance with the requirements of section 46-16.8, shall be levied, assessed, and collected as provided in this section on all gross proceeds and gross income taxable under this chapter.  No county shall set the surcharge on state tax at a rate greater than one-half of one per cent of all gross proceeds and gross income taxable under this chapter.  All provisions of this chapter shall apply to the county surcharge on state tax.  With respect to the surcharge, the director of taxation shall have all the rights and powers provided under this chapter.  No county shall conduct an independent tax audit of sellers registered under the streamlined sales and use tax agreement.  In addition, the director of taxation shall have the exclusive rights and power to determine the county or counties in which a person is engaged in business and, in the case of a person engaged in business in more than one county, the director shall determine, through apportionment or other means, that portion of the surcharge on state tax attributable to business conducted in each county."
     SECTION 12.  Section 237-9, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§237-9  Licenses; penalty.  (a)  Except as provided in this section, any person who has a gross income or gross proceeds of sales or value of products upon which a privilege tax is imposed by this chapter, as a condition precedent to engaging or continuing in [such] the business, shall in writing apply for and obtain from the department of taxation, upon a one-time payment of the sum of $20, a license to engage in and to conduct such business, upon condition that the person shall pay the taxes accruing to the State under this chapter, and the person shall thereby be duly licensed to engage in and conduct the business.  The license shall not be transferable and shall be valid only for the person in whose name it is issued and for the transaction of business at the place designated therein.  The license may be inspected and examined, and shall at all times be conspicuously displayed at the place for which it is issued.
     A seller registered under the streamlined sales and use tax agreement who is not otherwise obligated to obtain a license in the State is not required to obtain a license because of that registration.
     (b)  Licenses and applications therefor shall be in such form as the department shall prescribe, except that where the licensee is engaged in two or more forms of business of different classification, the license shall so state on its face.  The license provided for by this section shall be effective until canceled in writing.  Any application for the reissuance of a previously canceled license identification number after December 31, 1989, shall be regarded as a new license application and subject to the payment of the one-time license fee of $20.  The director may revoke or cancel any license issued under this chapter for cause as provided by rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91.
     (c)  Any person who receives gross income or gross proceeds of sales or value of products from engaging in business in the State and who fails to obtain a license or receives gross income or gross proceeds of sales or value of products from engaging in business in the State without a license required under this section may be fined not more than $500; provided that a cash-based business may be fined not less than $500 and not more than $2,000, as determined by the director or the director's designee.  The penalty under this subsection shall be in addition to any other penalty provided under law and may be waived or canceled upon a showing of good cause.
     (d)  If the license fee is paid, the department shall not refuse to issue a license or revoke or cancel a license for the exercise of a privilege protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, or for the carrying on of interstate or foreign commerce, or for any privilege the exercise of which, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, cannot be restrained on account of nonpayment of taxes, nor shall section 237-46 be invoked to restrain the exercise of such a privilege, or the carrying on of [such] interstate or foreign commerce.
     (e)  The director may permit a person engaged in network marketing, multi-level marketing, or other similar business to obtain the license required under this section for purposes of becoming a tax collection agent on behalf of its direct sellers.  The tax collection agent shall report, collect, and pay over the taxes due under this chapter and chapter 238 on behalf of its direct sellers who are covered by the tax collection agreement.  The tax collection agent's direct sellers shall be deemed to be licensed under this chapter; provided that the licensure shall apply solely to the business activity conducted directly through the marketing arrangement.  Under this section, a tax collection agent shall:
     (1)  Notify all of its direct sellers making sales in the State that it has been designated to collect, report, and pay over the tax imposed by this chapter and chapter 238 on their behalf on the business activity conducted through the marketing arrangement;
     (2)  If required by the director as a condition of obtaining the license, furnish with the annual return, a list (including identification numbers) of all direct sellers for the taxable year who have been provided (by the tax collection agent) information returns required under section 6041A (with respect to returns regarding payments of remuneration for services and direct sales) of the Internal Revenue Code [of 1986, as amended,] and any other information that is relevant to ensure proper payment of taxes due under this section; and
     (3)  Be personally liable for the taxes due and collected under the tax collection agreement if taxes are collected, but not reported or paid, together with penalties and interest as provided by law.
     (f)  The director may authorize a person to assume the obligation of self-accruing and remitting tax due on purchases or leases or rentals directly to the department under a direct payment authorization, if the following conditions are met:
     (1)  The authorization is to be used for the purchase or lease of tangible personal property or services;
     (2)  The authorization is necessary because it is either impractical at the time of acquisition to determine the manner in which the tangible personal property or services will be used or it will facilitate improved compliance with the tax laws of the State; and
     (3)  The person requesting authorization for direct payment maintains accurate and complete records of all purchases or leases and uses of tangible personal property or services purchased pursuant to the direct payment authorization in a form acceptable to the department.
     The department may identify items that are not eligible for a direct payment authorization.
     [(f)] (g)  For the purposes of this section:
     "Cash-based business" has the same meaning as in section 231-93.
     "Consumer product" shall include tangible consumer products and intangible consumer services.
     "Direct seller" means any person who is engaged in the trade or business of selling (or soliciting the sale of) consumer products:
     (1)  To any buyer on a buy-sell basis, a deposit-commission basis, or any similar basis, that the director prescribes by rule adopted pursuant to chapter 91, for resale other than in a permanent retail establishment;
     (2)  Other than in a permanent retail establishment; provided that:
         (A)  Substantially all the remuneration (whether or not paid in cash) for the sale of consumer products is directly related to sales or other output rather than to the number of hours worked; and
         (B)  The sales of consumer products by the person are performed pursuant to a written contract that provides that the person will not be treated as an employee with respect to those sales for federal or state tax purposes.
     "Direct seller" includes individuals who realize remuneration dependent on the productivity of other individuals in the marketing arrangement.
     "Network marketing" or "multi-level marketing" means a marketing arrangement in which consumer products are distributed and sold to or through direct sellers."
     SECTION 13.  Section 237-13, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§237-13  Imposition of tax.  There is hereby levied and shall be assessed and collected annually privilege taxes against persons on account of their business and other activities in the State measured by the application of rates against values of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income, whichever is specified, as follows:
    [(1)  Tax on manufacturers.
         (A)  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the State in the business of manufacturing, including compounding, canning, preserving, packing, printing, publishing, milling, processing, refining, or preparing for sale, profit, or commercial use, either directly or through the activity of others, in whole or in part, any article or articles, substance or substances, commodity or commodities, the amount of the tax to be equal to the value of the articles, substances, or commodities, manufactured, compounded, canned, preserved, packed, printed, milled, processed, refined, or prepared for sale, as shown by the gross proceeds derived from the sale thereof by the manufacturer or person compounding, preparing, or printing them, multiplied by one-half of one per cent.
         (B)  The measure of the tax on manufacturers is the value of the entire product for sale, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the State.
         (C)  If any person liable for the tax on manufacturers ships or transports the person's product, or any part thereof, out of the State, whether in a finished or unfinished condition, or sells the same for delivery to points outside the State (for example, consigned to a mainland purchaser via common carrier f.o.b. Honolulu), the value of the products in the condition or form in which they exist immediately before entering interstate or foreign commerce, determined as hereinafter provided, shall be the basis for the assessment of the tax imposed by this paragraph.  This tax shall be due and payable as of the date of entry of the products into interstate or foreign commerce, whether the products are then sold or not.  The department shall determine the basis for assessment, as provided by this paragraph, as follows:
              (i)  If the products at the time of their entry into interstate or foreign commerce already have been sold, the gross proceeds of sale, less the transportation expenses, if any, incurred in realizing the gross proceeds for transportation from the time of entry of the products into interstate or foreign commerce, including insurance and storage in transit, shall be the measure of the value of the products;
             (ii)  If the products have not been sold at the time of their entry into interstate or foreign commerce, and in cases governed by clause (i) in which the products are sold under circumstances such that the gross proceeds of sale are not indicative of the true value of the products, the value of the products constituting the basis for assessment shall correspond as nearly as possible to the gross proceeds of sales for delivery outside the State, adjusted as provided in clause (i), or if sufficient data are not available, sales in the State, of similar products of like quality and character and in similar quantities, made by the taxpayer (unless not indicative of the true value) or by others.  Sales outside the State, adjusted as provided in clause (i), may be considered when they constitute the best available data.  The department shall prescribe uniform and equitable rules for ascertaining the values;
            (iii)  At the election of the taxpayer and with the approval of the department, the taxpayer may make the taxpayer's returns under clause (i) even though the products have not been sold at the time of their entry into interstate or foreign commerce; and
             (iv)  In all cases in which products leave the State in an unfinished condition, the basis for assessment shall be adjusted so as to deduct the portion of the value as is attributable to the finishing of the goods outside the State.
     (2)] (1)  Tax on business of selling tangible personal property[; producing.]:
         (A)  Upon every person engaging or continuing in the business of selling any tangible personal property [whatsoever] (not including, however, bonds or other evidence of indebtedness, or stocks), unless subject to chapter A, there is [likewise] hereby levied, and shall be assessed and collected, a tax equivalent to four per cent of the gross proceeds of sales of the business; [provided that insofar as the sale of tangible personal property is a wholesale sale under section [237-4(a)(8)], the sale shall be subject to section 237-13.3.  Upon every person engaging or continuing within this State in the business of a producer, the tax shall be equal to one-half of one per cent of the gross proceeds of sales of the business, or the value of the products, for sale, if sold for delivery outside the State or shipped or transported out of the State, and the value of the products shall be determined in the same manner as the value of manufactured products covered in the cases under paragraph (1)(C).]
         (B)  Gross proceeds of sales of tangible property, unless subject to chapter A, in interstate and foreign commerce shall constitute a part of the measure of the tax imposed on persons in the business of selling tangible personal property, to the extent, under the conditions, and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and the Acts of the Congress of the United States [which] that may be now in force or may be hereafter adopted, and whenever there occurs in the State an activity to which, under the Constitution and Acts of Congress, there may be attributed gross proceeds of sales, the gross proceeds shall be so attributed[.
         (C)  No manufacturer or producer, engaged in such business in the State and selling the manufacturer's or producer's products for delivery outside of the State (for example, consigned to a mainland purchaser via common carrier f.o.b. Honolulu), shall be required to pay the tax imposed in this chapter for the privilege of so selling the products, and the value or gross proceeds of sales of the products shall be included only in determining the measure of the tax imposed upon the manufacturer or producer.];
        [(D)]  (C)  When a manufacturer or a producer[,] as defined under section A-3, engaged in [such] the business of manufacturing or producing in the State, also is engaged in selling the manufacturer's or producer's products in the State at wholesale[,] and taxed under chapter A, retail, or in any other manner, the tax for the privilege of engaging in the business of selling the products in the State shall apply to the manufacturer or producer as well as the tax for the privilege of manufacturing or producing in the State, and the manufacturer or producer shall make the returns of the gross proceeds of the wholesale, retail, or other sales required for the privilege of selling in the State, as well as making the returns of the value or gross proceeds of sales of the products required for the privilege of manufacturing or producing in the State.  The manufacturer or producer shall pay the tax imposed in this chapter for the privilege of selling its products in the State, and the value or gross proceeds of sales of the products, thus subjected to tax, may be deducted insofar as duplicated as to the same products by the measure of the tax upon the manufacturer or producer for the privilege of manufacturing or producing in the State[;] under chapter A; provided that no producer of agricultural products who sells the products to a purchaser who will process the products outside the State shall be required to pay the tax imposed in this chapter for the privilege of producing or selling those products[.]; and
       [(E)]  (D)  A taxpayer selling to a federal cost-plus contractor may make the election provided for by paragraph [(3)(C),] (2)(C), and in that case the tax shall be computed pursuant to the election, notwithstanding this paragraph [or paragraph (1)] to the contrary[.
         (F)  The department, by rule, may require that a seller take from the purchaser of tangible personal property a certificate, in a form prescribed by the department, certifying that the sale is a sale at wholesale; provided that:
              (i)  Any purchaser who furnishes a certificate shall be obligated to pay to the seller, upon demand, the amount of the additional tax that is imposed upon the seller whenever the sale in fact is not at wholesale; and
             (ii)  The absence of a certificate in itself shall give rise to the presumption that the sale is not at wholesale unless the sales of the business are exclusively at wholesale.];
    [(3)] (2)  Tax upon contractors[.]:
         (A)  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the State in the business of contracting, the tax shall be equal to four per cent of the gross income of the business[.];
         (B)  In computing the tax levied under this paragraph, there shall be deducted from the gross income of the taxpayer so much thereof as has been included in the measure of the tax levied under subparagraph (A), on:
              (i)  Another taxpayer who is a contractor, as defined in section 237-6;
             (ii)  A specialty contractor, duly licensed by the department of commerce and consumer affairs pursuant to section 444-9, in respect of the specialty contractor's business; or
            (iii)  A specialty contractor who is not licensed by the department of commerce and consumer affairs pursuant to section 444-9, but who performs contracting activities on federal military installations and nowhere else in this State;
              provided that any person claiming a deduction under this paragraph shall be required to show in the person's return the name and general excise number of the person paying the tax on the amount deducted by the person[.];
         (C)  In computing the tax levied under this paragraph against any federal cost-plus contractor, there shall be excluded from the gross income of the contractor so much thereof as fulfills the following requirements:
              (i)  The gross income exempted shall constitute reimbursement of costs incurred for materials, plant, or equipment purchased from a taxpayer licensed under this chapter, not exceeding the gross proceeds of sale of the taxpayer on account of the transaction; and
             (ii)  The taxpayer making the sale shall have certified to the department that the taxpayer is taxable with respect to the gross proceeds of the sale, and that the taxpayer elects to have the tax on gross income computed the same as upon a sale to the state government[.];
         (D)  A person who, as a business or as a part of a business in which the person is engaged, erects, constructs, or improves any building or structure, of any kind or description, or makes, constructs, or improves any road, street, sidewalk, sewer, or water system, or other improvements on land held by the person (whether held as a leasehold, fee simple, or otherwise), upon the sale or other disposition of the land or improvements, even if the work was not done pursuant to a contract, shall be liable to the same tax as if engaged in the business of contracting, unless the person shows that at the time the person was engaged in making the improvements the person intended, and for the period of at least one year after completion of the building, structure, or other improvements the person continued to intend to hold and not sell or otherwise dispose of the land or improvements.  The tax in respect of the improvements shall be measured by the amount of the proceeds of the sale or other disposition that is attributable to the erection, construction, or improvement of [such] the building or structure, or the making, constructing, or improving of the road, street, sidewalk, sewer, or water system, or other improvements.  The measure of tax in respect of the improvements shall not exceed the amount [which] that would have been taxable had the work been performed by another, subject as in other cases to the deductions allowed by subparagraph (B).  Upon the election of the taxpayer, this paragraph may be applied notwithstanding that the improvements were not made by the taxpayer, or were not made as a business or as a part of a business, or were made with the intention of holding the same.  However, this paragraph shall not apply in respect of any proceeds that constitute or are in the nature of rent; all [such] gross income shall be taxable under paragraph [(9);] (6); provided that insofar as the business of renting or leasing real property under a lease is taxed under section 237-16.5, the tax shall be levied by section 237-16.5[.];
    [(4)] (3)  Tax upon theaters, amusements, radio broadcasting stations, etc.
       [(A)]  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the State in the business of operating a theater, opera house, moving picture show, vaudeville, amusement park, dance hall, skating rink, radio broadcasting station, or any other place at which amusements are offered to the public, unless taxed under section A-6, the tax shall be equal to four per cent of the gross income of the business[, and in the case of a sale of an amusement at wholesale under section 237-4(a)(13), the tax shall be subject to section 237-13.3.
         (B)  The department may require that the person rendering an amusement at wholesale take from the licensed seller a certificate, in a form prescribed by the department, certifying that the sale is a sale at wholesale; provided that:
