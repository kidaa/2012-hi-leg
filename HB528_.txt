TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO AGRICULTURE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that many of our farmers and ranchers struggle to secure the financial support necessary to establish a thriving, vibrant business.  Many smaller farm or ranch owners may lack the necessary business and management expertise to seek out and apply for the various sources of funding available to them, including funding provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  To obtain grants from USDA, applicants must complete an application process that is sometimes arduous and complex.  Without specific technical expertise in grant writing, it is difficult for many small farmers or ranchers to access the funding available to them through USDA.
     The purpose of this Act is to establish a full-time grant writer position within the department of agriculture to assist farmers and ranchers to apply for and obtain grants offered by USDA.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $        or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 to establish one full-time grant writer position within the department of agriculture to assist farmers and ranchers to apply for and obtain grants offered by the United States Department of Agriculture.
     The sums appropriated shall be expended by the department of agriculture for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
