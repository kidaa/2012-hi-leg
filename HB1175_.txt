RELATING TO PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Act 253, Session Laws of Hawaii 2000, and Act 300, Session Laws of Hawaii 2006, aimed to reduce the number of civil service exempt employees in public service within the State.  The legislature finds that, despite these Acts, there have been few conversions of civil service exempt positions to civil service positions and that conversions are overdue.
     The purpose of this Act is to amend sections of the Hawaii Revised Statutes to conform with Act 253, Session Laws of Hawaii 2000, which placed restrictions on the creation of civil service exempt positions and required the annual review of exempt positions to determine whether exempt positions should remain exempt or be converted to civil service positions.
