TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO VOTING.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that section 11-136, Hawaii Revised Statutes, does not explicitly require the presentation of photo identification by every person applying to vote when signing the person's name in the poll book prepared for that purpose.
     The legislature further finds that while section 11-136, Hawaii Revised Statutes, requires a person to provide identification if so requested by an official, it does not explicitly define acceptable forms of voter identification. The lack of any requirement that a voter confirm his or her identity to a precinct official is a serious defect in our voting process. The current law must be changed in order to protect against voter fraud and ensure fair elections.
     The purpose of this Act is to require the presentation of an acceptable form of photo identification by every person applying to vote prior to signing the person's name in the poll book prepared for that purpose.
     SECTION 2.  Section 11-136, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§11-136  Poll book, identification, voting.  (a)  Every person upon applying to vote shall sign the person's name in the poll book prepared for that purpose.  This requirement may be waived by the chairperson of the precinct officials if for reasons of illiteracy or blindness or other physical disability the voter is unable to write.  Every person shall provide identification [if so requested by] to a precinct official.  The precinct official shall use the identification provided to confirm the identity of the person signing the poll book.  Identification provided to a precinct official shall contain a photograph of the person.  A poll book shall not contain the social security number of any person.
     After signing the poll book and receiving the voter's ballot, the voter shall proceed to the voting booth to vote according to the voting system in use in the voter's precinct. The precinct official may, and upon request shall, explain to the voter the mode of voting.
     (b)  The following forms of identification are acceptable proof of identification under this section:
          (1)  A valid driver's license issued by the State of Hawaii;
          (2)  A valid identification card issued by a branch, department, agency, or other governmental entity of the State of Hawaii, any other state, or the United States authorized by law to issue personal identification, provided that such identification card contains a photograph of the voter;
          (3)  A United States citizenship certificate issued to the person, provided that such certificate contains a photograph of the voter;
          (4)  A valid United States passport issued to the person; or
          (5)  A valid United States military identification card, provided that such identification card contains a photograph of the voter."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
