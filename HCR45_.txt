     WHEREAS, House Bill No.    (2012) proposes to regulate air conditioning pipefitters, fire sprinkler technicians, and solar technicians; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that air conditioning pipefitters, fire sprinkler technicians, and solar technicians are not required to have any type of certification or license to practice the occupations; and
 
     WHEREAS, the rise in demand for more efficient energy systems has resulted in the increasing popularity and need for the occupations of air conditioning pipefitters, fire sprinkler technicians, and solar technicians; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that the average citizen lacks the necessary knowledge or experience to determine whether the work of an air conditioning pipefitter, fire sprinkler technician, or solar technician is competent and safe; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that regulation of air conditioning pipefitters, fire sprinkler technicians, and solar technicians is necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the citizens of this State; and
 
     WHEREAS, House Bill No.    (2012) requires air conditioning pipefitters, fire sprinkler technicians, and solar technicians to be licensed by the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs; and
 
     WHEREAS, House Bill No.   (2012) would establish provisions designed to prevent unscrupulous and unqualified persons acting as air conditioning pipefitters, fire sprinkler technicians, and solar technicians from taking undue advantage of customers; and
 
     WHEREAS, section 26H-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, requires the Auditor to review proposals to regulate professions, vocations, or occupations that are currently unregulated and to assess alternative forms of regulation; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Auditor is requested to conduct a sunrise review of the regulation of air conditioning pipefitters, fire sprinkler technicians, and solar technicians as proposed under House Bill No.    , including an assessment of alternative forms of regulation, pursuant to section 26H-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor is requested to submit findings, recommendations, and any proposed legislation to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
