TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING FOOD MANUFACTURERS TO LABEL ALL GENETICALLY MODIFIED OR ENGINEERED FOOD PRODUCTS AS A "GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED FOOD PRODUCT".
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, Hawaii has a national reputation for high-quality food products and a pure and preserved natural environment, and the State's unique agricultural heritage and the vitality of its tourism industry rely upon this reputation; and
 
     WHEREAS, a poll conducted by the University of Hawaii's College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources shows that seventy-two per cent of Hawaii's residents feel that it is very important that genetically modified fruit be appropriately labeled; and
 
     WHEREAS, there is controversy regarding the nutritional impact that genetically engineered foods may have on the health of consumers who may want to know if they are ingesting food products that are genetically modified; and
 
     WHEREAS, numerous nations, including countries of the European Union, Japan, and China, require labeling of genetically engineered foods; and
 
     WHEREAS, mandatory labeling requirements would provide the basis for limiting dispersal of seeds from genetically engineered whole foods into the agricultural landscape and environment, thus mitigating the adverse environmental, agricultural, and economic impacts attributable to genetically engineered crop contamination episodes; and
 
     WHEREAS, genetically engineered food labeling could be implemented at a minimal cost to food producers and the government; and
 
     WHEREAS, labeling genetically modified or engineered foods will allow consumers to make more informed decisions regarding food product purchases; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that food manufacturers that manufacture or process any genetically-engineered or modified food products that are sold, offered for sale, or distributed in the State are urged to label their food products as genetically-engineered food products; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, the Chairperson of the Board of Agriculture, the Director of Health, the Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation, and the Hawaii Agriculture Research Center.
