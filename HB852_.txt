TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE LANAI WATERSHED.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the island of Lanai is one of the least forested of the main Hawaiian islands, has a relatively low annual rainfall, and has a sustainable yield from its aquifers of six million gallons per day.  A 1995 study estimated that more than sixty-five per cent of Lanai's primary aquifer's recharge comes from fog drip, and that "the loss of fog drip from Lana‘ihale would lead to the loss of more than 50% of the water levels in the island's central aquifer," which is the only viable water source for the island.  Studies indicate that fog drip interception by mountain forests increases precipitation by as much as thirty per cent and recharge by ten to fifteen per cent.  It is undisputed that the forest contributes to fog drip, and that the loss of forest cover will alter precipitation and recharge of the aquifer.
     The legislature finds that the execution of a watershed management plan that includes the removal of feral ungulates from Lana‘ihale, the control and removal of alien weeds, and the protection of the native forest should be among the priorities for the protection of this critical fresh water recharge area.
     The purpose of this Act is to provide matching funds to carry-out the watershed management plan for Lana‘ihale.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $           or so much thereof as may be necessary for the fiscal year 2011-2012 for the execution of the watershed management plan for Lana‘ihale on the island of Lanai, to be matched by private funds.
     SECTION 3.  The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of land and natural resources for the purposes of this Act.
SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
