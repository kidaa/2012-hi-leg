TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU TO EXTEND THE HOURS DURING WHICH PARKING IS PROHIBITED ON ISENBERG STREET.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, traffic congestion on Oahu continues to be a major concern; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Bingham Street off-ramp on the H-1 Freeway is a major exit for Moiliili residents, as well as residents of and visitors to the University of Hawaii at Manoa area; and
 
     WHEREAS, the City and County of Honolulu already recognizes the need to keep two lanes open for rush hour traffic on Isenberg Street between Beretania Street and South King Street by prohibiting parking on the Ewa side of Isenberg Street between the hours of 3:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.; and
 
     WHEREAS, traffic along Isenberg continues to be heavy after 5:30 p.m. as vehicles wishing to turn left onto South King Street prevent vehicles from continuing straight on Isenberg Street due to the parked vehicles blocking the right lane, often backing traffic up across Beretania Street; and
 
     WHEREAS, a simple, inexpensive solution to this problem would be to extend the hours when parking is prohibited along Isenberg Street for an additional thirty minutes from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the City and County of Honolulu is requested to extend the hours during which parking is prohibited on Isenberg Street between Young Street and South King Street for an additional thirty minutes from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu, Chairperson of the Honolulu City Council, and the Director of the Department of Transportation Services of the City and County of Honolulu.
