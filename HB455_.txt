TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the proper oversight of development plays an important role in balancing the preservation of coastal areas with commercial or residential development.  However, due to the rise of inflation, the cost of construction disqualifies most projects from special management area minor permits.  Increasing the valuation for minor permits, while requiring no adverse impacts to the environment, is vital to maintaining a balance between the two competing interests.
     The purpose of this Act is to:
     (1)  Exclude from the definition of "development" the consolidation and re-subdivision of a parcel of land under certain conditions; and
     (2)  Increase the threshold for special management area minor permits and special management area use permits.
     SECTION 2.  Section 205A-22, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows:
     1.  By amending the definition of "development" to read:
     ""Development" [means]:
     (1)  Means any of the uses, activities, or operations on land or in or under water within a special management area that are included below:
     [(1)] (A)  Placement or erection of any solid material or any gaseous, liquid, solid, or thermal waste;
     [(2)] (B)  Grading, removing, dredging, mining, or extraction of any materials;
     [(3)] (C)  Change in the density or intensity of use of land, including but not limited to the division or subdivision of land;
     [(4)] (D)  Change in the intensity of use of water, ecology related thereto, or of access thereto; and
     [(5)] (E)  Construction, reconstruction, demolition, or alteration of the size of any structure[.]; and
     ["Development" does]
     (2)  Does not include the following:
     [(1)] (A)  Construction of a single-family residence that is not part of a larger development;
     [(2)] (B)  Repair or maintenance of roads and highways within existing rights-of-way;
     [(3)] (C)  Routine maintenance dredging of existing streams, channels, and drainage ways;
     [(4)] (D)  Repair and maintenance of underground utility lines, including but not limited to water, sewer, power, and telephone and minor appurtenant structures such as pad mounted transformers and sewer pump stations;
     [(5)] (E)  Zoning variances, except for height, density, parking, and shoreline setback;
     [(6)] (F)  Repair, maintenance, or interior alterations to existing structures;
     [(7)] (G)  Demolition or removal of structures, except those structures located on any historic site as designated in national or state registers;
     [(8)] (H)  Use of any land for the purpose of cultivating, planting, growing, and harvesting plants, crops, trees, and other agricultural, horticultural, or forestry products or animal husbandry, or aquaculture or mariculture of plants or animals, or other agricultural purposes;
     [(9)] (I)  Transfer of title to land;
    [(10)] (J) Creation or termination of easements, covenants, or other rights in structures or land;
    [(11)] (K) Subdivision of land into lots greater than twenty acres in size;
    [(12)] (L) Subdivision of a parcel of land into four or fewer parcels when no associated construction activities are proposed; provided that any land which is so subdivided shall not thereafter qualify for this exception with respect to any subsequent subdivision of any of the resulting parcels;
         (M)  Consolidation and re-subdivision of a parcel of land; provided that no additional lots are created; provided further that roadway and utility lots shall not be counted as additional lots;
    [(13)] (N) Installation of underground utility lines and appurtenant aboveground fixtures less than four feet in height along existing corridors;
    [(14)] (O) Structural and nonstructural improvements to existing single-family residences, where otherwise permissible;
    [(15)] (P) Nonstructural improvements to existing commercial structures; and
    [(16)] (Q) Construction, installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of civil defense warning or signal devices and sirens;
provided that whenever the authority finds that any excluded use, activity, or operation may have a cumulative impact, or a significant environmental or ecological effect on a special management area, that use, activity, or operation shall be defined as "development" for the purpose of this part."
     2.  By amending the definition of "special management area minor permit" to read:
     ""Special management area minor permit" means an action by the authority authorizing development the valuation of which is not in excess of [$125,000] $250,000 and which has no substantial adverse environmental or ecological effect, taking into account potential cumulative effects."
     3.  By amending the definition of "special management area use permit" to read:
     ""Special management area use permit" means an action by the authority authorizing development the valuation of which exceeds [$125,000] $250,000 or which may have a substantial adverse environmental or ecological effect, taking into account potential cumulative effects."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
