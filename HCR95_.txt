     WHEREAS, homestead leases may extend up to one hundred ninety-nine years, with each lessee paying a lease fee of $1 per year; and
 
     WHEREAS, in addition to administering homestead leases, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands carries out other duties, such as the development of Hawaiian Home Lands for income-producing purposes or for homestead use through the provision of grants and technical assistance to beneficiary organizations; and
 
     WHEREAS, a comprehensive financial and management audit would be useful in providing insight into the operation of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands as a whole; now, therefore,
