A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the State is losing thousands of affordable housing units each year.  The State must make it a priority to replace the lost affordable housing units, especially affordable rental units.  The legislature further finds that once public school facilities are closed, the use of the land thereunder for the development of affordable rental housing would be cost effective and beneficial to the public.
     The purpose of this Act is to convey closed public school facilities to the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation for development of affordable rental housing, unless the department of education uses the facility to accomplish a greater public good.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§302A-    Public school closures; transfer.  Upon a determination and final action by the board to permanently close a public school facility, the board shall convey the closed public school facility real property to the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation for the development of affordable rental housing, unless the board uses the real property to accomplish, in the board's opinion, a greater public good.  A conveyance executed pursuant to this section shall be in accordance with section 171-64.7."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
