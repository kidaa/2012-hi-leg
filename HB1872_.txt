TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HURRICANE PROPERTY INSURANCE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that increases in hurricane property insurance premiums for Hawaii homeowners over the past twenty years have outpaced inflation and construction expenses despite no significant hurricane damage to the islands.  The legislature also finds that the current map hurricane property insurance providers use to determine risk and premiums is outdated and not reflective of actual damages.
     The purpose of this Act is to require hurricane property insurers to develop and approve new maps based upon actual damages to be used as the base to set hurricane property insurance premiums.
     SECTION 2.  (a)  After December 31, 2013, no hurricane property insurer shall charge hurricane property insurance rates that are higher than the rates the insurer charged on January 1, 1992, until the insurer creates and approves a geographic specific disaster model containing property zones depicting actual damages and losses from previous hurricanes.  The map shall not take into account predicted damages and losses.
     (b)  If a current hurricane property insurer did not provide hurricane property insurance in Hawaii during 1992, the provider shall charge rates based upon the average 1992 premiums for similar property in similar locations.
     SECTION 3.  (a)  Until the requirements of section 2 are met and notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the insurance commissioner shall not approve any rate filings that request an increase in hurricane property insurance rates.
     (b)  The insurance commissioner shall enforce the rate rollback required by this Act.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
