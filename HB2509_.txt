A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
MAKING AN EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS RELATED TO THE ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION MEETINGS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  This Act is recommended by the governor for immediate passage in accordance with section 9 of article VII of the Hawaii State Constitution.
     SECTION 2.  A critical fiscal need exists for the reimbursement of the costs of providing emergency management, public safety, and security in preparation for and during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings held in November 2011.  Seven state departments have identified expenditures made for the management, safety, and security required to host the APEC event.  While federal reimbursement of these costs is being applied for, reimbursement is not guaranteed and also not likely to be received within the current fiscal year.
     SECTION 3.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $2,709,966, or so much thereof as may be necessary, for fiscal year 2011-2012 to reimburse the moneys expended by the seven state departments for the costs related to APEC meetings.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of defense for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  With the approval of the governor, the department of defense may transfer to the respective departments funds for costs associated with providing emergency management, public safety, and security in preparation for and during the APEC meetings in November 2011.
     Section 5.  Should any expenditure paid for by general funds under this Act later become eligible for federal reimbursement the federal reimbursement funds shall be deposited into the general fund.
     SECTION 5.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
