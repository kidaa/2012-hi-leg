TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
ENCOURAGING SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENCE BUILDERS TO CONSIDER CERTAIN FACTORS THAT WILL FACILITATE INSTALLATION OF PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS WHEN CONSTRUCTING AND DEVELOPING SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENCES.
 
 

     WHEREAS, the installation of photovoltaic systems on existing structures can be hindered by initial construction design features that limit the physical space available for installation of photovoltaic systems and related equipment; and
 
     WHEREAS, Act 198, Session Laws of Hawaii 2011, established a working group to study the feasibility of requiring all new single-family residential construction to incorporate design elements to make the structure photovoltaic-ready at the time of initial construction; and
 
     WHEREAS, the working group considered strategies for facilitating the widespread adoption of photovoltaic systems including:
 
     (1)  Incorporating specific design elements in new residential structures to make the structures photovoltaic-ready;
 
     (2)  Minimizing retrofitting and equipment installation for future photovoltaic accommodation;
 
     (3)  Labeling blueprints with details of photovoltaic system accommodations and connections; and
 
     (4)  Identifying areas in the State where the use of photovoltaic systems would be impractical or where other renewable energy resources are more readily available; and
 
     WHEREAS, after considering strategies, discussing relevant issues, and investigating alternatives, the working group determined that technology advancement could ultimately render obsolete a policy mandating the incorporation of design elements to make structures photovoltaic-ready at the time of initial construction; and
 
     WHEREAS, a policy mandating the incorporation of design elements to make structures photovoltaic-ready at the time of initial construction could ultimately result in relatively little cost savings depending upon the choices of developers and consumers; and
 
     WHEREAS, the working group recommends against a policy mandating incorporation of design elements and minimal equipment installation to make structures photovoltaic-ready at the time of initial construction; and
 
     WHEREAS, despite the working group's recommendation, certain factors should be considered during the construction of single-family residences to facilitate the installation of photovoltaic systems in the future; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that single-family residence builders are encouraged to consider certain factors to facilitate installation of photovoltaic systems when constructing and developing single-family residences, including whether:
 
     (1)  A structure has a south-facing roof orientation with a slope of approximately twenty-two degrees for good solar exposure;
 
     (2)  A structure's roof area is adequate to accommodate multiple solar uses, such as solar water heating and photovoltaic energy systems;
 
     (3)  The structural integrity is adequate to accommodate photovoltaic panels and counteract wind loading, also known as up-lift;
 
     (4)  A structure's blueprints are labeled with photovoltaic system components;
 
     (5)  A structure's electrical panel capacity is sufficient to accommodate the total power coming into the building from all sources, including power from the electric utility grid and photovoltaic energy;
 
     (6)  A structure's electrical panel location is convenient for photovoltaic system interconnections;
 
     (7)  A structure's electrical panel contains adequate space to house a photovoltaic circuit breaker;
 
     (8)  A structure has an electrical conduit that connects the most appropriate solar collection location to the electrical panel and other relevant electrical components; and
 
     (9)  The combination of design and orientation of the structure precludes production of power from a photovoltaic energy system that will fully satisfy the structure's electrical load requirements; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the mayors of each county and the directors of the respective county building departments.
