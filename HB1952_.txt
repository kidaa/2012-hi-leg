RELATING TO BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  On January 5, 2012, Hawaii Medical Center Transplant Clinic, the only bone marrow transplant center in Hawaii, closed.  Some critical patients scheduled for bone marrow transplants found their procedures cancelled and a potentially life threatening situation confronting them.  Although the patients rescheduled their procedures and surgeries at mainland hospitals, their private insurance and medicare did not pay for travel and lodging expenses.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate $1,000,000, subject to a dollar-for-dollar match in private funds, for Hawaii Pacific Health to establish a bone marrow transplant program in Hawaii.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $1,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 as a grant subject to chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes, for Hawaii Pacific Health to establish a bone marrow transplant center; provided that these funds shall not be expended for any other purpose; provided further that no funds shall be expended unless matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis by private funds.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of health for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
