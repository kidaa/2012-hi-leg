TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE UNIFORM INFORMATION PRACTICES ACT.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii's citizens have been demanding more government transparency in recent years.  At the state and national levels, governments have increasingly enacted "sunshine laws" to promote greater openness and transparency in government processes, and to restore public confidence in the integrity of government.  The legislature also finds that increased transparency in the process used to appoint persons to positions in the judiciary and in executive and administrative offices and departments is consistent with these general principles.
The legislature recognizes that the Uniform Information Practices Act (Modified), chapter 92F of the Hawaii Revised Statues, was enacted to open up government processes to public scrutiny and participation, and to promote the public interest in disclosure, while balancing individual privacy interests with the public's right to know.  The legislature finds that while in the past, disclosure of a person's nomination for appointment to a governmental position was considered information in which the person had a significant privacy interest, current policies and priorities call for public disclosure of the names of such nominees prior to the appointment of any particular nominee, especially for nominees to the judiciary or to executive and administrative offices and departments.  The legislature further finds that the public interest in such disclosure outweighs the the privacy interest of any nominee and therefore does not constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that such disclosure will not frustrate a legitimate government function.
The purpose of this Act is to amend sections 92F-12 and 92F-14 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes to reflect changes consistent with these new policies and priorities.
     SECTION 2.  Section 92F-12, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "§92F-12  Disclosure required.  (a)  Any other provision in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, each agency shall make available for public inspection and duplication during regular business hours:

     "§92F-14  Significant privacy interest; examples.  (a)  Disclosure of a government record shall not constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the privacy interest of the individual.
