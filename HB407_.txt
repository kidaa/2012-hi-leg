RELATING TO HEALTH CARE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  Hawaii has enjoyed one of the highest rates of health care insurance coverage in the nation for more than thirty years, largely due to the prepaid health care act.  The director of labor and industrial relations administers the prepaid health care act and has the authority to determine which health plans may operate in Hawaii.  The director of labor and industrial relations is advised by the prepaid health care advisory council.

     The purpose of this Act is to include representatives from health care organizations on the prepaid health care advisory council, in order to give the council valuable perspectives on the design of health plan benefits.  This Act also increases the maximum membership of the prepaid health care advisory council from seven to nine.
     SECTION 2.  Section 393-7, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (d) to read as follows:
     "(d)  The prepaid health care advisory council shall be appointed by the director and shall include representatives of the medical and public health professions, representatives of health care provider organizations, representatives of consumer interests, and persons experienced in prepaid health care protection; provided that a person representing a health maintenance organization under chapter 432D, a mutual benefit society issuing individual and group hospital or medical service plans under chapter 432, or any other health care organization shall not be a member.  The membership of the council shall not exceed [seven] nine individuals."
     SECTION 3.  Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken.  New statutory material is underscored.

     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
