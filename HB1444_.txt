TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE HAWAII MEDICAL CENTER.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that organ transplantation is a life saving therapy for many critically ill patients with end-stage diseases.  Over one hundred ten thousand patients are on the nation's organ transplantation waiting list; four hundred seven of those patients are on the transplant waiting list in Hawaii.  The legislature further finds that the Transplant Institute of the Pacific at Hawaii Medical Center is the only organ transplantation program in the State, and dozens of kidney and liver transplantations are performed there each year.  In addition, patients who have received an organ transplant continue to receive monitoring and follow-up care after their operation at the Transplant Institute of the Pacific.
     The legislature finds that increased funding is crucial to maintain the financial health of the Transplant Institute of the Pacific.  The organ transplant program provides an important public resource to the State and to the many organ transplant patients and recipients in Hawaii.  Without an operational organ transplant center, patients with end-stage diseases would be forced to register on transplantation waiting lists for mainland transplant centers, many of which may have a longer waiting time to receive a donor organ than in Hawaii.  The increased waiting time for an organ may mean that the sickest of those patients may not survive long enough for a donor organ to become available.  In addition to increased waiting time, many waitlisted patients in Hawaii would have the additional burden of relocating to other areas of the country, away from friends and family, while awaiting a donor organ as well as during their recovery.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate moneys as a grant to the Transplant Institute of the Pacific at Hawaii Medical Center to support its continued operations.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $3,000,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 as a grant pursuant to chapter 42F, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to the Hawaii Medical Center to support ongoing services provided by the Transplant Institute of the Pacific.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of health for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
