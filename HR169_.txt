HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, CHAIRPERSON OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, HAWAII CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION, GOVERNOR, AND CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF HAWAII – MILITARY AFFAIRS COUNCIL, TO DO EVERYTHING WITHIN THEIR POWER AND INFLUENCE TO RETAIN MILITARY AND DEFENSE-RELATED CIVILIAN JOBS IN HAWAII.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, Hawaii is home to a number of major military installations and more than one hundred thousand service members and dependents; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2009, active-duty and Department of Defense civilian personnel comprised ten per cent of Hawaii's total work force; and
 
     WHEREAS, the RAND Corporation estimates that Department of Defense personnel expenditures in Hawaii averaged $4,200,000,000 per year in 2007-2009; and
 
     WHEREAS, the RAND Corporation estimates that Department of Defense procurement expenditures in Hawaii averaged $2,300,000,000 per year in 2007-2009; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is clear that Department of Defense expenditures have a profoundly positive impact on Hawaii's economy; and
 
     WHEREAS, recent federal budget cuts will cause the Department of Defense to reduce expenditures throughout the country by $500,000,000,000 to $1,000,000,000,000 over the next ten years; and
 
     WHEREAS, it is likely that the budget cuts will require the Department of Defense to consider eliminating jobs in Hawaii; and
 
WHEREAS, the relocation of a command from Hawaii to a location on the mainland could potentially result in the loss of thousands of military and civilian jobs; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the President of the United States, Chairperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of Defense, Hawaii congressional delegation, Governor, and Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii – Military Affairs Council, are urged to do everything within their power and influence to retain military and defense-related civilian jobs in Hawaii; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States, Chairperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of Defense, members of the Hawaii congressional delegation, Governor, and members of the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii - Military Affairs Council.
