     (b)  The lease rental of any lease agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (a) shall be no more than ten per cent below the prevalent market rate for lands of similar fair market value.
     (c)  In order to enter into a lease agreement pursuant to subsection (a):
     (1)  The corporation or partnership shall be a qualified community development entity, as that term is defined by section 45D(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code; and
