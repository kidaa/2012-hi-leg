A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE ARTICLE 9.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

SECTION 1.  Chapter 490, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding to article 9 a new part to be designated and to read as follows: 
"PART 8
TRANSITION PROVISIONS FOR 2010 AMENDMENTS
     §490:9-801  Effective date.  This Act takes effect on July 1, 2013.
     §490:9-802  Savings clause.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this part, this Act applies to a transaction or lien within its scope, even if the transaction or lien was entered into or created before this Act takes effect.
     (b)  This Act does not affect an action, case, or proceeding commenced before this Act takes effect.
     §490:9-803  Security interest perfected before effective date.  (a)  A security interest that is a perfected security interest immediately before this Act takes effect is a perfected security interest under article 9 as amended by this Act if, when this Act takes effect, the applicable requirements for attachment and perfection under article 9 as amended by this Act are satisfied without further action.
     (b)  Except as otherwise provided in section 490:9-805, if, immediately before this Act takes effect, a security interest is a perfected security interest, but the applicable requirements for perfection under article 9 as amended by this Act are not satisfied when this Act takes effect, the security interest remains perfected thereafter only if the applicable requirements for perfection under article 9 as amended by this Act are satisfied within one year after this Act takes effect.
     §490:9-804  Security interest unperfected before effective date.  A security interest that is an unperfected security interest immediately before this Act takes effect becomes a perfected security interest:
     (1)  Without further action, when this Act takes effect if the applicable requirements for perfection under article 9 as amended by this Act are satisfied before or at that time; or
     (2)  When the applicable requirements for perfection are satisfied if the requirements are satisfied after that time.
     §490:9-805  Effectiveness of action taken before effective date.  (a)  The filing of a financing statement before this Act takes effect is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under article 9 as amended by this Act.
`(b)  This Act does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before this Act takes effect, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in article 9 as it existed before amendment.  However, except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d) and section 490:9-806, the financing statement ceases to be effective:
     (1)  If the financing statement is filed in this State, at the time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective had this Act not taken effect; or
     (2)  If the financing statement is filed in another jurisdiction, at the earlier of:
         (A)  The time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of that jurisdiction; or
         (B)  June 30, 2018.
     (c)  The filing of a continuation statement after this Act takes effect does not continue the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect.  However, upon the timely filing of a continuation statement after this Act takes effect and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in article 9 as amended by this Act, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before this Act takes effect continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.
     (d)  Subsection (b)(2)(B) applies to a financing statement that, before this Act takes effect, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in article 9 as it existed before amendment, only to the extent that article 9 as amended by this Act provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.
     (e)  A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect and a continuation statement filed after this Act takes effect is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of part 5 as amended by this Act for an initial financing statement.  A financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a decedent's estate indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative within the meaning of section 490:9‑503(a)(2) as amended by this Act.  A financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a trust or is a trustee acting with respect to property held in trust indicates that the collateral is held in a trust within the meaning of section 490:9-503(a)(3) as amended by this Act.
     §490:9-806  When initial financing statement suffices to continue effectiveness of financing statement.  (a)  The filing of an initial financing statement in the office specified in section 490:9-501 continues the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect if:
     (1)  The filing of an initial financing statement in that office would be effective to perfect a security interest under article 9 as amended by this Act;
     (2)  The pre-effective-date financing statement was filed in an office in another state; and
     (3)  The initial financing statement satisfies subsection (c).
     (b)  The filing of an initial financing statement under subsection (a) continues the effectiveness of the pre-effective-date financing statement:
     (1)  If the initial financing statement is filed before this Act takes effect, for the period provided in unamended section 490:9-515 with respect to an initial financing statement; and
     (2)  If the initial financing statement is filed after this Act takes effect, for the period provided in section 490:9-515 as amended by this Act with respect to an initial financing statement.
     (c)  To be effective for purposes of subsection (a), an initial financing statement must:
     (1)  Satisfy the requirements of part 5 as amended by this Act for an initial financing statement;
     (2)  Identify the pre-effective-date financing statement by indicating the office in which the financing statement was filed and providing the dates of filing and file numbers, if any, of the financing statement and of the most recent continuation statement filed with respect to the financing statement; and
     (3)  Indicate that the pre-effective-date financing statement remains effective.
     §490:9-807  Amendment of pre-effective-date financing statement.  (a)  In this section, "pre-effective-date financing statement" means a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect.
     (b)  After this Act takes effect, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or otherwise amend the information provided in, a pre-effective-date financing statement only in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in article 9 as amended by this Act.  However, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement also may be terminated in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed.
     (c)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), if the law of this State governs perfection of a security interest, the information in a pre-effective-date financing statement may be amended after this Act takes effect only if:
     (1)  The pre-effective-date financing statement and an amendment are filed in the office specified in section 490:9-501;
     (2)  An amendment is filed in the office specified in section 490:9-501 concurrently with, or after the filing in that office of, an initial financing statement that satisfies section 490:9-806(c); or
     (3)  An initial financing statement that provides the information as amended and satisfies section 490:9‑806(c) is filed in the office specified in section 490:9-501.
     (d)  If the law of this State governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement may be continued only under section 490:9‑805(c) and (e) or 490:9-806.
     (e)  Whether or not the law of this State governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement filed in this State may be terminated after this Act takes effect by filing a termination statement in the office in which the pre-effective-date financing statement is filed, unless an initial financing statement that satisfies section 490:9-806(c) has been filed in the office specified by the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in article 9 as amended by this Act as the office in which to file a financing statement.
     §490:9-808  Person entitled to file initial financing statement or continuation statement.  A person may file an initial financing statement or a continuation statement under this part if:
     (1)  The secured party of record authorizes the filing; and
     (2)  The filing is necessary under this part:
         (A)  To continue the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect; or
         (B)  To perfect or continue the perfection of a security interest.
     §490:9‑809  Priority.  This Act determines the priority of conflicting claims to collateral.  However, if the relative priorities of the claims were established before this Act takes effect, article 9 as it existed before amendment determines priority."
     SECTION 2.  Section 490:9-102, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows:
     1.  By adding a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read:
     ""Public organic record" means a record that is available to the public for inspection and is:
     (1)  A record consisting of the record initially filed with or issued by a state or the United States to form or organize an organization and any record filed with or issued by the state or the United States that amends or restates the initial record;
     (2)  An organic record of a business trust consisting of the record initially filed with a state and any record filed with the state that amends or restates the initial record, if a statute of the state governing business trusts requires that the record be filed with the state; or
     (3)  A record consisting of legislation enacted by the legislature of a state or the Congress of the United States that forms or organizes an organization, any record amending the legislation, and any record filed with or issued by the state or the United States that amends or restates the name of the organization."
     2.  By amending the definitions of "authenticate", "certificate of title", "jurisdiction of organization", and "registered organization" to read:
     ""Authenticate" means:
     (1)  To sign; or
     (2)  [To execute or otherwise adopt a symbol, or encrypt or similarly process a record in whole or in part, with the present intent of the authenticating person to identify the person and adopt or accept a record.] With present intent to adopt or accept a record, to attach or to logically associate with the record an electronic sound, symbol, or process.
     "Certificate of title" means a certificate of title with respect to which a statute provides for the security interest in question to be indicated on the certificate as a condition or result of the security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the collateral.  The term includes another record maintained as an alternative to a certificate of title by the governmental unit that issues certificates of title if a statute permits the security interest in question to be indicated on the record as a condition or result of the security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the collateral.
     "Jurisdiction of organization", with respect to a registered organization, means the jurisdiction under whose law the organization is formed or organized.
     "Registered organization" means an organization formed or organized solely under the law of a single state or the United States [and as to which the state or the United States must maintain a public record showing the organization to have been organized.] by the filing of a public organic record with, the issuance of a public organic record by, or the enactment of legislation by the state or the United States.  The term includes a business trust that is formed or organized under the law of a single state if a statute of the state governing business trusts requires that the business trust's organic record be filed with the state."
     SECTION 3.  Section 490:9-105, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§490:9-105  Control of electronic chattel paper.  (a)  A secured party has control of electronic chattel paper if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the chattel paper reliably establishes the secured party as the person to which the chattel paper was assigned.  
     (b)  A system satisfies subsection (a) if the record or records comprising the chattel paper are created, stored, and assigned in such a manner that:
     (1)  A single authoritative copy of the record or records exists which is unique, identifiable and, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), unalterable;
     (2)  The authoritative copy identifies the secured party as the assignee of the record or records;
     (3)  The authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the secured party or its designated custodian;
     (4)  Copies or [revisions] amendments that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the [participation] consent of the secured party;
     (5)  Each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy; and
     (6)  Any [revision] amendment of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as [an] authorized or unauthorized [revision]."
     SECTION 4.  Section 490:9-307, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (f) to read as follows:

     (2)  In the state that the registered organization, branch, or agency designates, if the law of the United States authorizes the registered organization, branch, or agency to designate its state of location[;], including by designating its main office, home office, or other comparable office; or
     (3)  In the District of Columbia, if neither paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies."
     SECTION 5.  Section 490:9-311, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
     "(a)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), the filing of a financing statement is not necessary or effective to perfect a security interest in property subject to:
     (1)  A statute, regulation, or treaty of the United States whose requirements for a security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the property preempt section 490:9-310(a);
     (2)  Chapter 286; or
     (3)  A [certificate-of-title] statute of another jurisdiction which provides for a security interest to be indicated on [the] a certificate of title as a condition or result of the security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the property."
     SECTION 6.  Section 490:9-316, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§490:9-316  [Continued perfection of security interest following] Effect of change in governing law.  (a)  A security interest perfected pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in section 490:9-301(1) or 490:9-305(c) remains perfected until the earliest of:
     (1)  The time perfection would have ceased under the law of that jurisdiction;
     (2)  The expiration of four months after a change of the debtor's location to another jurisdiction; or
     (3)  The expiration of one year after a transfer of collateral to a person that thereby becomes a debtor and is located in another jurisdiction.
     (b)  If a security interest described in subsection (a) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter.  If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.
     (c)  A possessory security interest in collateral, other than goods covered by a certificate of title and as-extracted collateral consisting of goods, remains continuously perfected if:
     (1)  The collateral is located in one jurisdiction and subject to a security interest perfected under the law of that jurisdiction;
     (2)  Thereafter the collateral is brought into another jurisdiction; and
     (3)  Upon entry into the other jurisdiction, the security interest is perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction.
     (d)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a security interest in goods covered by a certificate of title which is perfected by any method under the law of another jurisdiction when the goods become covered by a certificate of title from this State remains perfected until the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become so covered.
     (e)  A security interest described in subsection (d)  becomes unperfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value if the applicable requirements for perfection under section 490:9-311(b) or 490:9-313 are not satisfied before the earlier of:
     (1)  The time the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become covered by a certificate of title from this State; or
     (2)  The expiration of four months after the goods had become so covered.
     (f)  A security interest in deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights, or investment property which is perfected under the law of the bank's jurisdiction, the issuer's jurisdiction, a nominated person's jurisdiction, the securities intermediary's jurisdiction, or the commodity intermediary's jurisdiction, as applicable, remains perfected until the earlier of:
     (1)  The time the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of that jurisdiction; or
     (2)  The expiration of four months after a change of the applicable jurisdiction to another jurisdiction.
     (g)  If a security interest described in subsection (f) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time or the end of the period described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter.  If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of that time or the end of that period, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.
     (h)  The following rules apply to collateral to which a security interest attaches within four months after the debtor changes its location to another jurisdiction:
     (1)  A financing statement filed before the change pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in section 490:9-301(1) or 490:9-305(c) is effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral had the debtor not changed its location; and
     (2)  If a security interest perfected by a financing statement that is effective under paragraph (1) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in section 490:9-301(1) or 490:9-305(c) or the expiration of the four-month period, it remains perfected thereafter.  If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.
     (i)  If a financing statement naming an original debtor is filed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in section 490:9-301(1) or 490:9-305(c) and the new debtor is located in another jurisdiction, the following rules apply:
     (1)  The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor before, and within four months after, the new debtor becomes bound under section 490:9-203(d), if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral had the collateral been acquired by the original debtor; and
     (2)  A security interest perfected by the financing statement and that becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in section 490:9-301(1) or 490:9-305(c) or the expiration of the four-month period remains perfected thereafter.  A security interest that is perfected by the financing statement but that does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value."
     SECTION 7.  Section 490:9-317, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended as follows:
     1.  By amending subsection (b) to read:
     "(b)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a buyer, other than a secured party, of tangible chattel paper, tangible documents, goods, instruments, or [a security certificate] certificated security takes free of a security interest or agricultural lien if the buyer gives value and receives delivery of the collateral without knowledge of the security interest or agricultural lien and before it is perfected."
     2.  By amending subsection (d) to read:
     "(d)  A licensee of a general intangible or a buyer, other than a secured party, of [accounts, electronic chattel paper, electronic documents, general intangibles, or investment property] collateral other than tangible chattel paper, tangible documents, goods, instruments, or a certificated security takes free of a security interest if the licensee or buyer gives value without knowledge of the security interest and before it is perfected."
     SECTION 8.  Section 490:9-326, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§490:9-326  Priority of security interests created by new debtor.  (a)  Subject to subsection (b), a security interest that is created by a new debtor [which is] in collateral in which the new debtor has or acquires rights and is perfected solely by a filed financing statement that [is effective solely under section 490:9-508 in collateral in which a new debtor has or acquires rights] would be ineffective to perfect the security interest but for the application of section 490:9-316(i)(1) or 490:9-508 is subordinate to a security interest in the same collateral which is perfected other than by such a filed financing statement [that is effective solely under section 490:9-508].
     (b)  The other provisions of this part determine the priority among conflicting security interests in the same collateral perfected by filed financing statements [that are effective solely under section 490:9-508.] described in subsection (a).  However, if the security agreements to which a new debtor became bound as debtor were not entered into by the same original debtor, the conflicting security interests rank according to priority in time of the new debtor's having become bound."
     SECTION 9.  Section 490:9-406, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (e) to read as follows:
     "(e)  Subsection (d) does not apply to the sale of a payment intangible or promissory note[.], other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under section 490:9-610 or an acceptance of collateral under section 490:9-620."
     SECTION 10.  Section 490:9-408, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:
     "(b)  Subsection (a) applies to a security interest in a payment intangible or promissory note only if the security interest arises out of a sale of the payment intangible or promissory note[.], other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under section 490:9-610 or an acceptance of collateral under section 490:9-620."
     SECTION 11.  Section 490:9-502, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:
     "(c)  A record of a mortgage is effective, from the date of recording, as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or as a financing statement covering as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut only if:
     (1)  The record indicates the goods or accounts that it covers;
     (2)  The goods are or are to become fixtures related to the real property described in the record or the collateral is related to the real property described in the record and is as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut;
     (3)  The record satisfies with the requirements for a financing statement in this section [other than an indication], but:
         (A)  The record need not indicate that it is to be filed in the real property records; and
         (B)  The record sufficiently provides the name of a debtor who is an individual if it provides the individual name of the debtor or the surname and first personal name of the debtor, even if the debtor is an individual to whom section 490:9-503(a)(4) applies; and
     (4)  The record is duly recorded."
     SECTION 12.  Section 490:9-503, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§490:9-503  Name of debtor and secured party.  (a)  A financing statement sufficiently provides the name of the debtor:

     (2)  [If] Subject to subsection (f), if the [debtor is a decedent's estate,] collateral is being administered by the personal representative of a decedent, only if the financing statement provides, as the name of the debtor, the name of the decedent and, in a separate part of the financing statement, indicates that the [debtor is an estate;] collateral is being administered by a personal representative;
     (3)  If the [debtor is a trust or a trustee acting with respect to property held in trust, only if the financing statement:
         (A)  Provides the name specified for the trust in its organic documents or, if no name is specified, provides the name of the settlor and additional information sufficient to distinguish the debtor from other trusts having one or more of the same settlors; and
         (B)  Indicates, in the debtor's name or otherwise, that the debtor is a trust or is a trustee acting with respect to property held in trust; and]
          collateral is held in a trust that is not a registered organization, only if the financing statement:
         (A)  Provides, as the name of the debtor:
              (i)  If the organic record of the trust specifies a name for the trust, the name specified; or
             (ii)  If the organic record of the trust does not specify a name for the trust, the name of the settlor or testator; and
         (B)  In a separate part of the financing statement:

     (4)  Subject to subsection (g), if the debtor is an individual to whom this State has issued a driver's license or non-driver identification card that has not expired, only if the financing statement provides the name of the individual that is indicated on the driver's license or non-driver identification card;
     (5)  If the debtor is an individual to whom paragraph (4) does not apply, only if the financing statement provides the individual name of the debtor or the surname and first personal name of the debtor; and

     (2)  Unless required under subsection [(a)(4)(B),] (a)(6)(B), names of partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor.
     (c)  A financing statement that provides only the debtor's trade name does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor.

     SECTION 13.  Section 490:9-507, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:
     "(c)  If [a debtor so changes its] the name that a filed financing statement provides for a debtor becomes insufficient as the name of the debtor under section 490:9-503(a) so that the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under section 490:9-506:
     (1)  The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor before, or within four months after, the [change;] filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading; and
     (2)  The financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor more than four months after the [change,] filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading, unless an amendment to the financing statement which renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within four months after [the change.] the financing statement became seriously misleading."
     SECTION 14.  Section 490:9-515, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by amending subsection (f) to read as follows:
     "(f)  If a debtor is a transmitting utility and a filed initial financing statement so indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed."

         (B)  In the case of an amendment or [correction] information statement, the record:
