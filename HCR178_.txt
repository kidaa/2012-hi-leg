HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING AN AUDIT OF ALL STATE DEPARTMENT EXPENDITURES RELATING TO MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS AND EXPENDITURES.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the various State Departments expend large amounts of monies each year on the maintenance of facilities and equipment; and
 
     WHEREAS, maintenance contracts help keep major building facilities working consistently to avoid disruptions and to ensure safe and secure work places; and
 
     WHEREAS, keeping business equipment properly serviced maximizes the useful life of the equipment and reduces unexpected interruptions to work productivity; and
 
     WHEREAS, the annual cost of maintenance agreements throughout all agencies and departments of the State of Hawaii is a substantial sum of money; and
 
     WHEREAS, it may be financially beneficial for the State of Hawaii to self-insure some or all of these maintenance costs; now therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that each of the various State departments are requested to report to the Legislature on the costs of facilities maintenance and contracts for servicing business equipment; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature further requests that the report also considers the following:
     (1)  The costs of performing maintenance duties by                  existing State maintenance staff versus contracting           with outside vendors; and
 
     (2) Lower cost alternatives which can potentially save             State funds (i.e. purchasing energy efficient                  electronic equipment); and
 
     (3)  Assessment from each department on the recordation,            reporting, and record-keeping processes for all such               expenses; and
 
     (4)  Summary recommendations from the State's Chief                 Information Officer (CIO) on what technology                   accommodations can better ensure accurate and                  efficient record keeping as well as reporting and              analysis for such expenses; and
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the various State agencies work in collaboration with the Department of Budget and Finance in preparing the report; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Budget and Finance is requested to submit the findings and recommendations to the Legislature no later than 20 days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor and the Director of the Department of Budget and Finance.
