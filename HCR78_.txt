URGING THE GOVERNOR, DEPARTMENT OF HAWAIIAN HOME LANDS, AND DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY TO CONSIDER DEVELOPING A NEW CORRECTIONAL FACILITY ON THE LAND ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HAWAIIAN HOME LANDS THAT IS ADJACENT TO HILO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.
 
 

     WHEREAS, there is not enough space in the correctional facilities located in the State to house all of the State's prisoners; and
 
     WHEREAS, the State does not have a sophisticated projection regarding the future growth of the state prison population and consequently, cannot know whether the facilities currently being utilized will be able to meet the future demand for space; and
 
     WHEREAS, approximately one-third of the State's prisoners are already incarcerated out of state and severed from critical access to their families and communities; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Governor's administration would like prisoners of the State to return from the mainland; and
 
     WHEREAS, a component of Governor Abercrombie's "A New Day" plan includes stopping the practice of sending state prisoners to prisons on the mainland; and
 
     WHEREAS, in that same plan, Governor Abercrombie also states his intention to "build secure prison facilities in Hawaii on the basis of cost-effectiveness, safety, and benefit to the community"; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Governor, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, and the Department of Public Safety are respectfully urged to consider developing a new correctional facility on the land administered by the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands which is adjacent to Hilo International Airport; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Chairperson of the Hawaiian Homes Commission, and Director of Public Safety.
