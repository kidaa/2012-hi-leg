     [(f)  In addition to subsection (e), the director shall affirm the administrative revocation of the registration of any motor vehicle owned by or registered to the respondent only if the director determines that the respondent is a repeat intoxicated driver.  If the director affirms the administrative revocation pursuant to this subsection, the director shall order the respondent to surrender the number plates and motor vehicle registration of any motor vehicle owned by or registered to the respondent.  The director may destroy any number plates taken into custody.
     (g)] (f)  The respondent's prior alcohol and drug enforcement contacts shall be entered into evidence.
     [(h)] (g)  The sworn statements provided in section 291E-36 shall be admitted into evidence.  The director shall consider the sworn statements in the absence of the law enforcement officer or other person.  Upon written notice to the director, no later than five days prior to the hearing, that the respondent wishes to examine a law enforcement officer or other person who made a sworn statement, the director shall issue a subpoena for the officer or other person to appear at the hearing.  Personal service upon the law enforcement officer or other person who made a sworn statement shall be made no later than forty-eight hours prior to the hearing time.  If the officer or other person cannot appear, the officer or other person at the discretion of the director, may testify by telephone.

     [(l)] (k)  The director may grant a special motor vehicle registration, pursuant to section 291E-48, to a qualified household member or a co-owner of any motor vehicle upon determination that:
     (1)  The person is completely dependent on the motor vehicle for the necessities of life; and

     [(f)] (e)  Alcohol and drug enforcement contacts that occurred prior to January 1, 2002, shall be counted in determining the administrative revocation period.
     (g)] (f)  The requirement to provide proof of financial responsibility pursuant to section 287-20 shall not be based upon a revocation under subsection (b)(1)."
