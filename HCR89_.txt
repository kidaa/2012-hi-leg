URGING THE HAWAII PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY TO APPLY FOR A CHOICE NEIGHBORHOODS GRANT.
 
 

WHEREAS, many public housing projects owned and operated by the Hawaii Public Housing Authority ("Authority") are in poor physical condition and require repairs and modernization; and
 
WHEREAS, the Authority has reported that as many as four hundred to six hundred units cannot be rented out due to uninhabitable conditions; and
 
WHEREAS, during the 2010 federal inspections, eleven out of the sixty-five federal public housing projects failed to pass, receiving a score of fifty-nine or below out of a possible one hundred, and approximately one-third of the Authority's federal public housing projects received a score of sixty-nine or below; and
 
WHEREAS, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's ("HUD") Choice Neighborhoods Grant Program transforms distressed neighborhoods and public and assisted projects into viable and sustainable mixed-income neighborhoods by linking housing improvements with appropriate services, schools, public assets, transportation, and access to jobs; and
 
WHEREAS, a notice of funding availability for the Choice Neighborhoods Grant Program was announced by HUD in January, and the Authority is an eligible applicant; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Hawaii Public Housing Authority is urged to apply for a Choice Neighborhoods Grant; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Executive Director of the Hawaii Public Housing Authority and Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Hawaii Public Housing Authority.
