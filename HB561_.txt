TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO PUBLIC ASSISTANCE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that there are persons who receive health insurance coverage through the State's QUEST or QUEST-net program and also have private health insurance coverage.  The legislature further finds that the intent of the QUEST and QUEST-net programs is to provide publicly-funded health insurance coverage for persons who are unable to afford private insurance but whose incomes and assets exceed the requirements to qualify for medicaid.  The legislature finds that providing benefits from a publicly-funded QUEST or QUEST-net program when the person can afford private health insurance is contrary to the intent of the QUEST programs and should be prevented.
     The purpose of this Act is to ensure that private insurance is the primary payor of medical claims for persons who have health insurance coverage both through the QUEST or QUEST-net programs and a private health insurance plan.
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 346, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:
     "§346-     Supplemental private health insurance coverage; notice to department.  (a)  QUEST or QUEST-net vendors under contract with the department shall notify the department of QUEST or QUEST-net enrollees who also have coverage through a private health care insurer.
     (b)  When a person covered by insurance through QUEST or QUEST-net also has health insurance coverage through a private health insurance plan, the private health insurance plan shall be the primary payor of any covered claims and the QUEST or QUEST-net shall be the secondary payor."
     SECTION 3.  New statutory material is underscored.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
