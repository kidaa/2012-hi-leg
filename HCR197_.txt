HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE AUDITOR TO CONDUCT A STUDY TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF CONSOLIDATING OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY OF ADULT RESIDENTIAL CARE AND FOSTER HOME FACILITIES UNDER A SINGLE DEPARTMENT.
 
 

     WHEREAS, adult residential care and foster home facilities are important options for elderly persons who require living assistance in Hawaii; and
 
     WHEREAS, the State has a compelling interest in ensuring that adult residential care and foster home facilities are properly regulated so that they are able to deliver safe, quality, and low-cost care in the most efficient manner possible; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that Hawaii has a very complex system of community-based residential care settings for the elderly, including Adult Residential Care Homes, Extended Care Adult Residential Care Homes, Community Care Foster Family Homes, and Assisted Living Facilities; and
 
     WHEREAS, there exists a division of responsibility for regulating and overseeing residential care facilities for the elderly in Hawaii:  the Department of Health is responsible for licensing Adult Residential Care Homes, Extended Care Adult Residential Care Homes, and Assisted Living Facilities, whereas the Department of Human Services is responsible for licensing Community Care Foster Family Homes; and
 
     WHEREAS, although a study conducted by the Auditor in 2002 recommends that the Departments of Health and Human Services continue to separately regulate adult residential care and foster home facilities, Hawaii stakeholders continue to recommend that regulation be consolidated under a single agency to improve the quality of care they provide; and
 
     WHEREAS, efficiency dictates that a single government agency oversee all aspects of adult residential care and foster home facilities, so that an integrated, comprehensive home and community-based residential care system can be implemented; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Auditor is requested to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of a single agency overseeing all aspects of adult residential care and foster home facilities; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor's study include an assessment of the current state allocation of responsibilities for quality assurance across departments, a review of the standards and inspection processes for residential care facilities and nursing homes, and recommendations for an integrated management strategy for adult residential care and foster home facilities; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor's study include proposed amendments to existing law necessary to effectuate the recommendations of the study; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor is requested to submit findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Auditor, Director of Human Services, Director of Health, and Hawaii Long-Term Care Commission.
