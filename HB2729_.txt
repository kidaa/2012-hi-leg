TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
MAKING AN APPROPRIATION FOR ADULT EDUCATION.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that a public education is more than just teaching the rudiments of reading, writing, and arithmetic—a public education also prepares students to be contributing members of a democratic society.  A community with members who do not have a well-developed educational foundation cannot meet its potential to compete in a competitive, international economic environment. 
     The legislature further finds that there exists a need to provide quality educational programs for those students who fall outside of the traditional age range for public school.  For these adult students, adult educational programs provide a means through which they can access basic educational skills, complete a high school education, and more actively participate in civic life. 
     In addition, adult educational programs contribute to the overall well-being of Hawaii residents in that they act as a connection for adults who would otherwise find themselves isolated in an increasingly interconnected society through life enhancement courses and, through workforce training, provide continued access to the job market for those who may find themselves unemployed.
     The purpose of this Act, therefore, is to appropriate general funds to maintain adult educational programs for Hawaii's residents.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $3,500,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2012-2013 to maintain adult educational programs.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of education for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2012.
