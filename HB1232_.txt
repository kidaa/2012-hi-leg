STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
MAKING AN APPROPRIATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that Hawaii imports most of its beef and only a small percentage of the cattle raised in Hawaii are consumed within the State.  The majority of locally-raised cattle are shipped to the mainland for finishing and slaughter.
     The legislature has long recognized the benefits of maintaining the viability of the State's beef industry for local consumption in an effort to increase Hawaii's food self-sufficiency and overall sustainability.
     The legislature also finds that adequate resources are necessary to promote ranching and an increase in cattle production.
     The purpose of this Act is to appropriate moneys to the department of agriculture to purchase a slaughterhouse within the Campbell Industrial Park on the island of Oahu and to make necessary capital improvements thereto. 
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $1,000,000, or so much thereof as may be necessary for the fiscal year 2011-2012, for the department of agriculture to:
     (1)  Acquire a slaughterhouse within the Campbell Industrial Park on the island of Oahu;
     (2)  Fund necessary construction, renovation, and improvement projects at the slaughterhouse; and
     (3)  Purchase equipment for the slaughterhouse. 
     SECTION 3.  The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of agriculture for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 4.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
