HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DISABILITY AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS BOARD, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE HAWAII STATE ENERGY OFFICE, TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE INTERPLAY OF RESERVED PARKING STALL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISABLED PERSONS AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the federal Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities requires that a certain number of parking stalls be reserved for use by disabled persons if parking spaces are provided for self-parking by employees or visitors; and
 
     WHEREAS, state law requires that certain public and private parking stalls be reserved for persons with disabilities who display the appropriate permit, placard, or license plate; and
 
     WHEREAS, section 291-71, Hawaii Revised Statutes, requires that "all public, private, and government parking facilities that are available for use by the general public and have at least one hundred parking spaces shall designate one per cent of parking spaces exclusively for electric vehicles by December 31, 2011, provided that at least one of the parking spaces designated for electric vehicles is located near the building entrance and is equipped with an electric vehicle charging unit"; and
 
     WHEREAS, reservation of parking spaces for disabled persons should take priority over spaces that are reserved for electric vehicles; and
 
     WHEREAS, some private businesses are redesignating parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities as spaces now to be reserved for electric vehicles, to the detriment of disabled residents and visitors of the State and denying them the full protection of the law; and
 
     WHEREAS, state administrators in charge of overseeing the implementation of reserved parking requirements for the disabled and for electric vehicles should clarify the priorities on number and location of the respective reserved parking spaces; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Disability and Communication Access Board, in consultation with the Hawaii State Energy Office, is requested to report to the Legislature, no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 2013, on the interplay of reserved parking space requirements for disabled persons and electric vehicles, including number and location of parking spaces; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that any administrative rule or policy should make reservation of parking for disabled persons a priority over the reservation of electric vehicle parking spaces; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that any administrative rule or policy should provide that electric car parking stalls should be placed only where there are charging stations; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Executive Director of the Disability and Communication Access Board and the Energy Administrator of the Hawaii State Energy Office.
