TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HEALTH CARE.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the growth rate of the elderly population in the State, those sixty-five years and older, is expected to accelerate.  The United States Bureau of the Census reports that the proportion of Hawaii's population classified as elderly is expected to increase from 12.6 per cent in 1995 to 15.9 per cent in 2025.  The increasing proportion of the elderly requires that the State take action to anticipate and prepare for the future health care needs of Hawaii's population.
     The United States Congress has already recognized the need for health care reform and enacted the Affordable Care Act in 2010.  The Affordable Care Act is intended to improve health care in America by, among other things, establishing a competitive health insurance market, ending discrimination against pre-existing health conditions, expanding medicaid coverage, enhancing the quality of health care, and reducing health care fraud and waste.  The legislature finds that Hawaii should take similar actions to improve health care in the State.  One organizational change that could improve government efficiency and health care is to consolidate certain health care services that are currently managed by the department of health and the department of human services.
     The legislature finds that the department of health has already established an office of health care assurance that manages state licensing and federal certification of medical and health care facilities, agencies, and services provided throughout the State to ensure compliance with established standards of care.  Given the office's existing functions, the legislature finds that health care services currently provided by the department of human services and the department of health should be consolidated under the jurisdiction of the office of health care assurance to improve the efficiency, capacity, and quality of state health care services.
     The purpose of this Act is to consolidate the authority, duties, responsibilities, and jurisdiction of the department of human services and the department of health, as they relate to various health care services, by transferring to the department of health office of health care assurance on July 1, 2014, the programs of the department of human services relating to:
     (1)  Home and community-based case management;
     (2)  Community care foster family homes; and
     (3)  Adult day care.
