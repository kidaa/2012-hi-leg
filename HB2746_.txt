TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE LABELING OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that a poll conducted by the University of Hawaii's college of tropical agriculture and human resources shows that seventy-two per cent of Hawaii's residents feel that it is very important that genetically modified fruit be labeled.  Numerous nations, including countries of the European Union, Japan, and China, require labeling of genetically engineered foods.  West Hawaii Today reported on September 1, 2011, that Japan approved importation of genetically modified papayas if labeled as such.  This was the last step in a ten-year effort to get papayas introduced into Japan, a huge market for papaya growers.
     Hawaii has a national reputation for producing high-quality foods and maintaining a pure and preserved natural environment.  The State's unique agricultural heritage and vitality of its tourism industry rely upon this reputation.
     Although genetically engineered crops in the United States have contaminated conventional and organic crops of the same species via pollen or seed dispersal, Hawaii papaya growers have found a method of utilizing genetic engineering technology to improve papaya crops without contamination to other crops or harm to humans.
     Mandatory labeling of genetically engineered whole foods:
     (1)  Would meet the demand of Hawaii's residents for informed choice concerning the foods they consume;
     (2)  Would provide the basis for limiting dispersal of seeds from genetically engineered whole foods into the agricultural landscape and environment, thus mitigating the adverse environmental, agricultural, and economic impacts accompanying genetically engineered crop contamination episodes; and
     (3)  Could be implemented at a minimal cost to food producers and the government.
     The purpose of this Act is to require the labeling of genetically engineered whole food produced, sold, or distributed in Hawaii.
     SECTION 2.  Section 328-1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding three new definitions to be appropriately inserted and to read as follows:
     ""Genetically engineered food crop" means a plant in which the genetic material has been changed through modern biotechnology in a way that does not occur naturally by multiplication or natural recombination, or both.
     "Genetically engineered whole food" means any genetically engineered food crop in its raw or natural state that is intended for human consumption, including all fruits that are washed, colored, or otherwise treated in their unpeeled natural form prior to marketing.
     "Modern biotechnology" means the application of in vitro nucleic acid techniques, including recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid and direct injection of nucleic acid into cells or organelles.  This also includes the fusion of cells (including protoplast fusion) or hybridization techniques beyond the taxonomic family that overcome natural physiological, reproductive, or recombination barriers and that are not techniques used in traditional breeding and selection.  Those techniques include recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid techniques that use vector systems and techniques involving the direct introduction into the organism of hereditary materials prepared outside the organism such as micro—injection, macro-injection, chemoporation, electroporation, micro—encapsulation and liposome fusion."
     SECTION 3.  Section 328-6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§328-6  Prohibited acts.  The following acts and the causing thereof within the State by any person are prohibited:
     (1)  The manufacture, sale, delivery, holding, or offering for sale of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded;

     (6)  The refusal to permit entry or inspection, or to permit the taking of a sample, as authorized by sections 328-22 and 328-23 to 328-27, or to permit access to or copying of any record as authorized by section 328-23;
     (7)  The giving of a guaranty or undertaking which guaranty or undertaking is false, except by a person who relied on a guaranty or undertaking to the same effect signed by, and containing the name and address of the person residing in the State from whom the person received in good faith the food, drug, device, or cosmetic;
     (8)  The removal or disposal of a detained or embargoed article in violation of sections 328-25 to 328-27;
     (9)  The alteration, mutilation, destruction, obliteration, or removal of the whole or any part of the labeling of, or the doing of any other act with respect to a food, drug, device, or cosmetic, if the act is done while the article is held for sale and results in the article being adulterated or misbranded;

    (18)  Wilfully and falsely representing or using any devices, substances, methods, or treatment as effective in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or alleviation of cancer.  This paragraph shall not apply to any person who depends exclusively upon prayer for healing in accordance with teachings of a bona fide religious sect, denomination, or organization, nor to a person who practices such teachings;
