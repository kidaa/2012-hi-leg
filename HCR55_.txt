REQUESTING THE AUDITOR TO CONDUCT A MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL AUDIT OF THE UNIVERSITY CLINICAL, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, INC.
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Office of the Auditor conducted a financial audit of the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine (School) for the fiscal year July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002; and
 
     WHEREAS, the audit examined the financial records and transactions of the School, reviewed the related systems of accounting and internal controls, and tested transaction systems and procedures for compliance with laws and regulations; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Auditor's report recommended that the School revise the way it handles contract negotiations with health care organizations and commence services only after contracts are finalized and executed; and
 
     WHEREAS, the University Clinical, Education and Research Associates, Inc. is a separately incorporated not-for-profit corporation that contributes to the School's goal of improving the health care status of the citizens of Hawaii and the Pacific area by supporting the academic mission of the School; and
 
     WHEREAS, the University Clinical, Education and Research Associates, Inc. functions as a practice plan for the faculty of the School, providing a vehicle by which clinical revenues can be generated on a limited scale during the faculty's non-university, private practice; and
 
     WHEREAS, the financial information for the University Clinical, Education and Research Associates, Inc. was not included in the fiscal year 2001-2002 financial audit of the School that was conducted by the Office of the Auditor because the School and the University of Hawaii are not financially accountable for these entities; and
 
     WHEREAS, a management and financial audit of the University Clinical, Education and Research Associates, Inc. should be conducted because the program is a School-related entity; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Auditor is constitutionally and statutorily responsible for auditing state and county programs, expenditures, and any agencies that receive state funds and undertakes audits at the request of the Legislature or upon the Auditor's initiative; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Auditor is requested to conduct a management and financial audit of the University Clinical, Education and Research Associates, Inc.; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Auditor is requested to submit a report of any audit findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the Regular Session of 2013; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Auditor, the Governor, the President of the University of Hawaii, the Chairperson of the University of Hawaii Board of Regents, the Dean of the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine, and the Chief Executive Officer of the University Clinical, Education and Research Associates, Inc.
