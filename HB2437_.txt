TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO ELECTIONS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

SECTION 1.  This Act is recommended by the governor for immediate passage in accordance with section 9 of article VII of the constitution of the State of Hawaii.
SECTION 2.  The purpose of this Act is to make an emergency appropriation to fund the voting system contract for the 2012 elections.  Without an emergency appropriation the office of elections will not be able to conduct the 2012 elections.  Additionally, the State of Hawaii will be out of compliance with its obligations under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-252).
SECTION 3.  The Help America Vote Act of 2002, 42 USC § 15481, mandates various voting system standards.  The currently unfunded voting system contract allows the State of Hawaii to meet those standards.
SECTION 4.  The operating budget of the office of elections for fiscal year 2011-2012 is $1,829,581.  The Help America Vote Act of 2002, 42 USC § 15404(a)(7), mandates, as a condition of the prior receipt of federal payments, the maintenance of expenditures of the state for activities funded by the payment at a level that is not less than the level of such expenditures maintained by the state for the fiscal year ending prior to November 2000.  The level of such expenditures in fiscal year 1999-2000 was $2,299,552.  The State of Hawaii has always met this requirement.  The present operating budget of the office of elections, unless supplemented by an emergency appropriation, will not meet this maintenance of effort requirement, which will result in prior and future federal funding being compromised.
SECTION 5.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii, the sum of $1,725,000, or so much thereof as is necessary, for fiscal year 2011-2012 for the purpose of funding the payment of the voting system contract for the 2012 elections.  The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of accounting and general services for the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 6.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
