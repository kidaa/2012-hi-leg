HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO ESTABLISH A STATE HEALTH PLAN INITIATIVE TO REDUCE THE OCCURRENCES OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE IN HAWAII.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a serious lung disease that makes it difficult for a person to breathe; the disease includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis; and
 
     WHEREAS, although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is progressive, it is very preventable and treatable, and hopefully, it will be curable in the future; and
 
     WHEREAS, twenty-four million persons have been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and as many as five hundred thousand persons have the disease but are undiagnosed; and
 
     WHEREAS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the third leading cause of death in the United States, and kills more than one hundred twenty thousand persons a year, or one person every four minutes; in 2010, the disease cost the United States government an estimated $50,000,000,000 in direct and indirect expenses; and
 
     WHEREAS, early screening and detection are critical because most persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are not diagnosed until they have already lost half of their lung function; and
 
     WHEREAS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease kills more women than men each year, and in 2006, the disease killed more women than breast cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes combined; and
 
     WHEREAS, there is no cure for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but proper management of the disease can lead to improved quality of life and self-sufficiency for affected patients; and
 
     WHEREAS, the State should encourage efforts to prevent chronic diseases to prevent future medical costs, and the Department of Health should develop an action plan for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease education and awareness, as well as early diagnosis and testing; and
 
     WHEREAS, to further reduce the state and federal costs of Medicare and Medicaid and lost time, the Department of Health should include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in its chronic disease initiatives and advocate for transitional care programs and third party reimbursements; and
 
     WHEREAS, coordinated community efforts such as the Hawaii Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Coalition have been formed to promote public-private partnerships to bring together resources to serve all residents afflicted by the disease, improve the quality of life of those living with the disease, and reduce the burden that results from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Health is requested to establish a state health initiative to reduce the occurrences of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Hawaii; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Director of Health and the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Hawaii Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Coalition.
