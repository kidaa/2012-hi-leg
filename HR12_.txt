WHEREAS, in 1987, the United States Congress declared March as "Women's History Month" to acknowledge the important role women have played in shaping America; and
 
WHEREAS, although women constitute a majority of the nation's population, their achievements and contributions are underrepresented in museums and memorials; and
 
WHEREAS, only ten percent of the people identified in a recent survey of eighteen history textbooks were women; and
 
WHEREAS, in 1999, The President's Commission on the Celebration of Women in American History called for a women's history museum to be established on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.; and
 
WHEREAS, the National Women's History Museum, founded in 1996, is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, educational institution dedicated to preserving, interpreting, and celebrating the diverse historic contributions of women, and integrating the heritage of women fully into this nation's history; and
 
WHEREAS, the National Women's History Museum seeks a site on or close to the National Mall and in close proximity to the White House and United States Capitol Building; and
 
WHEREAS, the National Women's History Museum has identified federally owned property for sale near the National Mall; and
 
WHEREAS, legislation is currently pending in the United States Congress seeking authorization for the National Women's History Museum to purchase this property at fair market value with privately raised funds; and
 
     WHEREAS, no federal funds are being requested for the purchase of this property; and
 
WHEREAS, there are museums dedicated to flight, postage stamps, buildings, and many other important issues and people of interest, but there is not a museum dedicated solely to women, who comprise fifty-one percent of the nation's population; and
 
WHEREAS, the National Women's History Museum will showcase the full history of women in the United States and the contributions they have made and continue to make in the marketplace, arts and sciences, government, entertainment, education, home, and community; and
 
WHEREAS, a coalition of forty-three women's organizations representing 8 million women, which includes the National Foundation for Women Legislators, Inc., supports the efforts of the National Women's History Museum to establish a permanent residence near the National Mall, the most prominent location for museums to be situated in the nation's capital; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that Hawaii's Congressional delegation is requested to support the efforts of the National Women's History Museum to secure a permanent home in the nation's capital for a museum that will highlight the important role women have played in shaping this great nation; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to Hawaii's Congressional delegation, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Women's History Museum, and the President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Foundation for Women Legislators, Inc.
