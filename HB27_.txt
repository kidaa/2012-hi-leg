A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO SCHOOLS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that a key factor influencing a student's ability to learn in public schools is the learning environment.  Students learn best when they are physically comfortable and free from unnecessary distractions.  Given Hawaii's tropical climate and high temperatures, schools should be equipped with air conditioning to ensure that students have the most comfortable learning environment conducive to fulfilling their educational potential.
     The purpose of this Act is to require the installation of air conditioning in all public schools based upon the priority established by the department of education.
     SECTION 2.  Section 302A-1501, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:
     "§302A-1501  Noise and climate control at school facilities.  (a)  This section shall be known and may be cited as the First Things First Act.
     (b)  The department shall plan for[,] and request appropriations necessary to implement[, acoustic] the following:
     (1)  Acoustic noise control [and air conditioning] of existing and new school facilities in areas that are [susceptible to extremes of temperature or] affected by aircraft, traffic, and other noise[.]; and
     (2)  Air conditioning of existing and new school facilities.
The department shall develop appropriate standards and consider local conditions [for] in deciding whether acoustic noise control and air conditioning of existing and new school facilities are required for effective classroom instruction[.], including standards to justify why acoustic noise control or air conditioning is not needed.  [In all cases where] Where acoustic treatment of school facilities is planned, the department shall utilize the services of individuals qualified by training and experience to recommend appropriate noise control procedures and components.  Acoustic noise control and air conditioning shall be given equal weight [as] with all other factors in the criteria used by the department in setting priorities for school construction and renovations.
     (c)  Where air conditioners are installed in a school, the department may require that the approximate cost of electricity and maintenance for air conditioners in the school that are not installed by the department of accounting and general services be paid by a private entity until the department establishes temperature and noise standards and a policy relating to air conditioning.
     (d)  Based upon the standards established in subsection (b), the department shall establish a priority list of schools that are in greatest need of air conditioning; provided that if any administrative office in a departmental school district has air conditioning, then the department shall include all schools in that district on the priority list to have air conditioning installed.  Based on the priority list, air conditioning shall be installed in school facilities as follows, the:
     (1)  First twenty per cent of schools on the priority list by December 31, 2012;
     (2)  Second twenty per cent of schools on the priority list by December 31, 2013;
     (3)  Third twenty per cent of schools on the priority list by December 31, 2014;
     (4)  Fourth twenty per cent of schools on the priority list by December 31, 2015; and
     (5)  Fifth twenty per cent of schools on the priority list by December 31, 2016."
