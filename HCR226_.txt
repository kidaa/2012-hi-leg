RESOLUTION
 
 
URGING THE HAWAII PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY TO HONOR H.C.R. NO. 282, H.D. 1, "URGING THE HAWAII PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM RENT SCHEDULE", THAT WAS ADOPTED DURING THE REGULAR SESSION OF 2009.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, Hawaii Public Housing Authority's mission is to provide adequate and affordable housing over the long term for low-income individuals, which includes the management and operation of public housing programs in the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, Hawaii Public Housing Authority's scope of responsibility includes collecting rent from housing tenants, examining tenants' incomes annually, and repairing and maintaining public housing facilities; and
 
     WHEREAS, according to the State Auditor's report, "Management Audit of the Hawai`i Public Housing Authority," dated June 2011:
 
(1)  Delays in turning around vacant units to new tenants impact families waiting for public housing, rent revenues, and overall funding available to the Hawaii Public Housing Authority; and
 
(2)  Approximately 9,000 families are on the waiting list for public housing and the average wait time is between two and five years; and
 
WHEREAS, there are tenants who pay no rent, minimal rent, and are in arrears; and
 
WHEREAS, section 356D-43, Hawaii Revised Statutes, requires Hawaii Public Housing Authority to fix the rates of rentals for dwelling units and other facilities in state low-income housing projects at rates that will produce revenues that are sufficient to pay all expenses of management, operation, and maintenance, including other related costs, to the end that state low-income housing projects are and remain self-supporting; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2009, the Legislature adopted H.C.R. No. 282, H.D. 1, which urged the Hawaii Public Housing Authority to increase the minimum rent for state public housing to no less than $250 per unit, with a yearly increase equal to the increase in the cost-of-living index, subject to certain conditions; however; to date the remedies recommended by H.C.R. No. 282, H.D. 1 have not been employed by the Authority; and
 
     WHEREAS, imposing a minimum rent schedule for low-income housing would strengthen the availability of adequate and affordable housing for low-income individuals; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Hawaii Public Housing Authority is urged to honor H.C.R. No. 282, H.D. 1, "URGING THE HAWAII PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM RENT SCHEDULE", that was adopted during the Regular Session of 2009; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Director of Human Services, Executive Director of the Hawaii Public Housing Authority, and the Hawaii Regional Administrator of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
