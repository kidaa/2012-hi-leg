HOUSE RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII BOARD OF REGENTS TO STUDY THE REINTEGRATION OF THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA WITH THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII SYSTEM.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the Hawaii State Constitution guarantees that the Board of Regents of the University of Hawaii shall have the exclusive jurisdiction over the internal structure, management, and operation of the University of Hawaii, subject only to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Legislature to identify and enact laws of statewide concern; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Hawaii State Constitution also specifies that the Board of Regents shall appoint the President of the University of Hawaii to act as its executive officer; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2001, the University of Hawaii was reorganized so that the University of Hawaii System and the University of Hawaii-Manoa are no longer led by the same executive officer; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2001, the Board of Regents reorganized the organizational structure of the University with the understanding that establishing the Office of the Chancellor of the University of Hawaii-Manoa would incur no additional administrative costs to the University; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2011, the Office of the Chancellor of the University of Hawaii-Manoa required an annual operational budget of $14.7 million; and
 
     WHEREAS, in 2011, it was also estimated that there had been over $6.4 million in additional administrative costs at the University of Hawaii-Manoa since the establishment of the Office of the Chancellor of the University of Hawaii-Manoa; and
 
     WHEREAS, while the University of Hawaii has begun a nationwide search for a new Chancellor for its Manoa Campus as the current Chancellor of the University of Hawaii-Manoa will step down from the position at the end of the 2011–2012 school year, debate continues as to whether or not it is necessary for the University of Hawaii to maintain the Office of Chancellor for its Manoa Campus; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, that the Board of Regents of the University of Hawaii is respectfully requested to study whether the reintegration of the Office of the Chancellor of the University of Hawaii-Manoa with the Office of the President of the University of Hawaii System is prudent; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board of Regents is requested to report its findings and recommendations to the Legislature no later than 20 days prior to the convening of the 2012 Regular Session; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Chair of the Board of Regents of the University of Hawaii, Chancellor of the University of Hawaii-Manoa, and President of the University of Hawaii System.
