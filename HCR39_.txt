STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
AFFIRMING THE LEGISLATURE'S SUPPORT OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION'S CURRENT RULES AND SAFETY GUIDELINES RELATING TO UNMANNED AIRCRAFT.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, the United States air transportation system is the safest, most efficient, and largest in the world; and
 
     WHEREAS, aviation in Hawaii plays a critical role in the economy, supporting tourism, and bringing family and friends together across the State; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Federal Aviation Administration continues to protect the physical safety of the national airspace, including protection of individuals on the ground; and
 
     WHEREAS, due to safety concerns, the Federal Aviation Administration continues to limit and attach strict conditions on the use of domestic unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones; and
 
     WHEREAS, the Federal Aviation Administration is under strong industry and congressional pressure to pave the way for domestic deployment of drone aircraft; and
 
     WHEREAS, many common uses of drone aircraft, including search and rescue, fighting wildfires, and conducting dangerous tactical police operations, are beneficial; and
 
     WHEREAS, however, drone aircraft equipped with cameras raises the prospect of a significant new avenue for the surveillance of American life; and
 
     WHEREAS, citizens need a system of rules to ensure that the citizens of the United States can enjoy the benefits of drone technology, without bringing the populace a large step closer to a surveillance society in which every move is monitored, tracked, recorded, and scrutinized by those in possession of drone technology; and
 
     WHEREAS, the increased use of potentially unsafe technologies without significant oversight and regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration would create an unneeded hardship on all of Hawaii's residents and visitors; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Legislature affirms its support of the Federal Aviation Administration's current rules and safety guidelines relating to unmanned aircraft operations; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Acting Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, Hawaii's congressional delegation, the Governor, the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, and the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.
