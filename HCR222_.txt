HOUSE CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION
 
 
REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO EXTEND THE HOURS OF OPERATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION WORKER IDENTIFICATION CREDENTIAL ENROLLMENT CENTER ON OAHU AND TO OPEN A SECOND CENTER LOCATED AROUND THE PORT AREA OR WEST OF THE PORT AREA ON OAHU.
 
 
 

     WHEREAS, a transportation worker identification credential is a biometric credential that ensures that only vetted workers are eligible to gain unescorted access to secure areas of a Maritime Transportation Security Act-regulated port or vessel; and
 
     WHEREAS, all Coast Guard-credentialed merchant mariners, port facility employees, long shore workers, truck drivers, and other persons requiring unescorted access to secure areas of maritime facilities and vessels regulated by the Maritime Transportation Security Act are required to have transportation worker identification credential cards; and
 
     WHEREAS, applicants for a transportation worker identification credential card may pre-enroll online, but must actually go to the enrollment center to complete the enrollment process, which includes paying the enrollment fee and completing a disclosure form; and
 
     WHEREAS, the only transportation worker identification credential enrollment center on the island of Oahu is located on Kalanianaole Highway and open from Monday to Thursday, 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 12:30 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.; and
 
     WHEREAS, because of the enrollment center's limited hours of operation, many people who need to obtain a transportation worker identification credential card have to take time off from work to go to the enrollment center; and
 
     WHEREAS, extending the enrollment center's hours of operation on the weekdays and opening the enrollment center on the weekends and opening a second enrollment center location will facilitate access to the enrollment center for those persons who need a transportation worker identification credential; now, therefore,
 
     BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2012, the Senate concurring, that the Department of Homeland Security is urged to extend the hours of the transportation worker identification credential enrollment center on the weekdays and to open on the weekends and to open a second enrollment center around the port area or west of the port area; and
 
     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the Governor, Secretary of Homeland Security, members of Hawaii's congressional delegation, and Chairperson of the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii-Military Affairs Council.
