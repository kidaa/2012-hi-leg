TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2011
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO HEALTH.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature has historically recognized the importance of making medicaid coverage available for the State's most vulnerable populations, and understands that medicaid payments to providers must be sufficient to cover the actual costs of the care provided.  Through the continued efforts of Hawaii's congressional delegation, a federal medicaid disproportionate share hospital appropriation of $10,000,000 per year (or $2,500,000 per quarter) has been secured for Hawaii through 2019.  However, these funds cannot be drawn down without a matching state appropriation.  The legislature finds that the combined state and federal funding will help to provide continuing health care in Hawaii's communities.
     The appropriation contained in this Act matches $10,000,000 in federal disproportionate share hospital funds that are available for the second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2010 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2011.
     The legislature acknowledges that the amount of the state match is dependent upon the federal medical assistance percentage in the year the funds are spent.  For fiscal year 2010, Hawaii's federal medical assistance percentage is 54.24 per cent, meaning that in order to draw down the $7,500,000 in available federal disproportionate share hospital funds for the three quarters in 2010, the State is obligated to provide the remainder, or 45.76 per cent, of the total funding, which is $6,327,434.  For fiscal year 2011 Hawaii's federal medical assistance percentage is 51.79 per cent.  To draw down the $2,500,000 in federal disproportionate share hospital funds for the first quarter of 2010, the State is obligated to provide $2,327,187.  The total for the four quarters is $8,654,621.
     SECTION 2.  There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of Hawaii the sum of $8,654,621 or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year 2011-2012 to match the federal disproportionate share hospital allowance allocated to the State.
     The sum appropriated shall be expended by the department of human services for the purposes of this Act.

     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect on July 1, 2011.
