TWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012
 
STATE OF HAWAII
 
 
 
 
 
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT
 
 
RELATING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HAWAIIAN HOME LANDS.
 
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 

     SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that the waiting period for native Hawaiians to be placed on Hawaiian home lands is extremely long due in large part to the delay caused by the process of funding, planning, designing, and constructing utility infrastructure for vacant undeveloped lots.  The legislature further finds that many native Hawaiians on the waiting list are willing and able to provide for themselves if given the opportunity to develop the land that they are entitled to occupy.
     The purpose of this Act is to place eligible native Hawaiians on Hawaiian home lands faster, without having to wait for development infrastructure to be built, while still meeting basic habitation requirements and pertinent federal regulations.
     SECTION 2.  (a)  The department of Hawaiian home lands shall develop and administer an off-the-grid living program to permit homesteaders to occupy Hawaiian home lands prior to installation of utility infrastructure; provided that the homesteader is able to meet basic habitation requirements, including the provision of potable water, wastewater treatment, and electrical power.  The department shall also ensure compliance with pertinent federal regulations.
     (b)  The structures built pursuant to this Act shall be exempt from the state building code, as provided by chapter 107, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and any county code; provided that the intent of the state building code and county codes shall be implemented through administrative rules.
     (c)  The department of Hawaiian home lands shall adopt rules under chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to effectuate the purposes of this Act.
     SECTION 3.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
